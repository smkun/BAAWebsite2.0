                <p class="text">
                    <strong>BE IT KNOWN</strong><br />
                    That we, the Avengers, have banded together to protect and
                    safeguard the planet Earth, its inhabitants, and resources
                    from any and all threats, terrestrial or otherwise, which
                    might prove to be beyond the power of conventional forces to
                    handle.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    That we shall tolerate no interference in the growth of
                    humanity in meeting its rightful destiny.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    That we dedicate ourselves to the establishment, growth, and
                    preservation of peace, liberty, equality, and justice under
                    law.
                </p>
                <p class="text">This is our solemn oath.</p>

                <h2 class="home-heading">Article One: Organization</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    The Avengers are chartered as a nonprofit organization under
                    the laws of the United States. The organization is fully
                    sanctioned as a peacekeeping force by the National Security
                    Council of the United States, the United Nations, and
                    S.H.I.E.L.D.
                </p>

                <h2 class="home-heading">Article Two: Jurisdiction</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    The Avengers are authorized to operate in all territories of
                    the United States and any United Nations-affiliated member
                    nations, in accordance with national and international laws.
                </p>

                <h2 class="home-heading">Article Three: Funding</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    The Avengers are funded primarily by private grants. Major
                    funding is provided by the Maria Stark Foundation (Anthony
                    Stark, Director) and additional funding from the United
                    Nations. These grants are accepted with the understanding
                    that neither the Foundation nor the United Nations shall
                    influence Avengers operations or financial allocations.
                </p>

                <h2 class="home-heading">Article Four: Operations</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    The daily operations of the Avengers shall be governed by a
                    set of bylaws established by the founding members.
                </p>
