                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Origin:</strong><br />
                    Founded in the late 1990s by a group of disillusioned
                    environmental scientists and activists, The Greenhouse was
                    established by those who believed that traditional
                    conservation and protest methods were failing to address the
                    escalating climate crisis.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Structure:</strong><br />
                    - Operates in cells, with each cell specializing in a
                    different aspect of their mission.<br />
                    - At the top is a council of seven known as "The
                    Cultivators," each representing a different biome of
                    Earth.<br />
                    - Dr. Vivian Bloom leads the Research &amp; Development
                    cell, focusing on creating enhanced plant life and
                    bioweapons.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Goals:</strong><br />
                    - To "reclaim" urban areas for nature by developing
                    plant-based lifeforms capable of overtaking and transforming
                    cities into self-sustaining ecosystems.<br />
                    - Ultimately, to create a new balance between humanity and
                    nature, even if it requires drastically reducing the human
                    population.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Methods:</strong><br />
                    - Utilizes a mix of legitimate front companies,
                    eco-terrorism, and advanced biotechnology.<br />
                    - Has developed several genetically modified plant species
                    designed to rapidly grow in urban environments, some with
                    defensive capabilities.<br />
                    - Employs hackers to target industrial control systems,
                    causing "accidents" that damage urban infrastructure and
                    facilitate the spread of their enhanced flora.

                    <strong>Boston Connection:</strong><br />
                    - Boston was chosen for its abundance of research
                    institutions and strategic coastal location.<br />
                    - Maintains several legitimate botanical research facilities
                    around the city as fronts for radical experiments.<br />
                    - Has been slowly introducing enhanced plant species into
                    Boston's parks and green spaces, creating hidden networks of
                    controlled flora.

                    <strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
                    - The escape of Sunny has thrown The Greenhouse into
                    disarray; some members see it as a sign to reconsider their
                    methods, while others—such as Dr. Bloom—remain determined to
                    create controllable plant-based lifeforms.<br />
                    - The organization is currently split between those who wish
                    to capture Sunny for further study and those who view the
                    plant being as a threat to be eliminated.<br />
                    - Unbeknownst to most members, "Rootmother" has made contact
                    with an alien plant intelligence and is planning to take The
                    Greenhouse's mission to a cosmic scale.
