                    <strong>Elena Pappas</strong> came from a family of runners.
                    Her grandfather competed in the Boston Marathon twelve
                    consecutive years. Her mother qualified for the Olympic
                    trials. The Pappas name appeared in local running club
                    records going back three generations.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Elena seemed destined to continue this legacy, showing
                    remarkable endurance even as a child. But while her family
                    celebrated traditional athletic achievement, Elena's
                    relationship with running went deeper. For her, running
                    wasn't just movement—it was a state of mind, a way of
                    processing the world.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Growing up in Boston's Brighton neighborhood, Elena used the
                    city streets as her training ground. She knew every alley,
                    shortcut, and dead-end from Allston to Brookline. Her high
                    school track coach called her "GPS in sneakers" for her
                    uncanny ability to calculate optimal routes on the fly.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    MIT recruited her for their engineering program after she
                    designed a revolutionary running shoe as a high school
                    project. Her academic work focused on biomechanics and
                    efficiency of movement, with research that attracted
                    attention from both athletic companies and military
                    contractors.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Everything changed during her junior year. While running
                    data collection for her research along the Charles River,
                    Elena witnessed a boat collision. Without hesitation, she
                    dove into the water to help. As she pulled survivors to
                    shore, observers were stunned by her speed—moving across
                    water and land faster than humanly possible.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The stress of the emergency had triggered a latent metahuman
                    ability. Elena found herself processing time differently
                    when in motion. The faster she moved, the more the world
                    seemed to slow around her. Her perception, reaction time,
                    and physical capabilities all amplified with speed.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Initially, Elena tried to ignore these changes. She withdrew
                    from competitions, knowing her abilities would give her an
                    unfair advantage. She focused on her research instead, using
                    herself as a test subject to study the theoretical limits of
                    human movement.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Meanwhile, reports spread of a mysterious figure rescuing
                    people from accidents across Boston—appearing suddenly at
                    crash sites, pulling people from burning buildings, stopping
                    assaults in progress. Few connected these incidents to the
                    quiet engineering student who ran at odd hours.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Samuel Revere made the connection. After tracking Elena's
                    movements for weeks, he approached her after a particularly
                    daring rescue. Elena expected recruitment to a government
                    program or research initiative. Instead, Sam offered
                    something that had been missing since her abilities emerged:
                    purpose.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The Minutemen needed someone who could respond to crises
                    across the city in moments, someone who could evacuate
                    civilians and provide rapid reconnaissance. For Elena, it
                    was an opportunity to use her abilities without compromising
                    her principles.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    As Marathon, Elena serves as the team's rapid response
                    specialist. Her speed allows her to reach emergencies before
                    other members, assess situations, and begin civilian
                    evacuation. In combat, she strikes from multiple angles,
                    creating the impression of several fighters attacking
                    simultaneously.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Her specialized equipment complements her abilities. The
                    friction-resistant suit she designed prevents heat buildup
                    at high speeds. Her reinforced gloves allow her to deliver
                    repeated high-speed strikes without injury. The
                    communications earpiece provides real-time coordination with
                    Beacon, who often directs her movements across the
                    battlefield.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Between missions, Elena continues her research at MIT, now
                    focused on emergency response optimization. Her algorithms
                    for urban evacuation have been adopted by Boston's disaster
                    preparedness office, though officials don't know they were
                    developed by the same person who tests them in real crises.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The constant motion takes its toll. Elena rarely sleeps more
                    than four hours at a stretch, her mind racing even when her
                    body rests. She runs an average of 50 miles daily, burning
                    energy that her accelerated metabolism requires. Her
                    apartment contains minimal furniture but multiple treadmills
                    and equipment for monitoring her physical condition.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Within the team, Elena forms the point of a tactical
                    triangle with Beacon and Liberty—Beacon identifies threats,
                    Marathon engages or evacuates civilians, and Liberty
                    confronts the primary danger. She works well with Greenway
                    during environmental missions, quickly distributing his
                    botanical countermeasures across affected areas.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    "Speed isn't just about getting somewhere first," she
                    explains during team training sessions. "It's about having
                    time to make the right decision when everyone else is still
                    processing what happened."
