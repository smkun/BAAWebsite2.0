                    <strong>The Weight of Knowledge</strong><br />
                    Dr. Alistair Graves was never meant for an ordinary life.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Born into a lineage of scholars, mystics, and occultists
                    stretching back centuries, he was raised in the shadow of
                    forbidden knowledge. His mother, Eleanor Graves, was a
                    renowned archaeologist and expert in ancient civilizations,
                    while his father, Benedict Graves, was something else
                    entirely—a practitioner of true magic, a sorcerer dedicated
                    to the unseen forces that shaped reality.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Alistair spent his childhood surrounded by forgotten tomes,
                    whispered incantations, and stories of realms beyond human
                    comprehension. While other children learned history from
                    textbooks, he learned it from scrolls that smelled of old
                    leather and power. While others played sports, he was
                    memorizing runes of protection, testing the edges of the
                    supernatural world.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    But his father never forced magic upon him. “If you seek
                    power for its own sake,” Benedict had warned, “it will
                    consume you.”
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    So Alistair did what his father wanted. He studied.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    By the time he was an adult, he had earned degrees in
                    comparative mythology, history, and linguistics, eventually
                    becoming a professor of Occult Studies at Harvard. He became
                    respected for his insight into ancient magic systems,
                    consulting with historians, cryptologists, and even certain
                    clandestine government agencies when their research veered
                    too close to things that should remain buried.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    But all the while, he felt the pull—the knowledge his father
                    had kept from him, the magic he had been told to resist.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Then, the barriers between worlds cracked, and Alistair
                    could not ignore it any longer.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Ritual That Changed Everything</strong><br />
                    It started as an anomaly, a mystical distortion detected on
                    an excavation site in Eastern Europe. Artifacts were found
                    etched with symbols older than recorded history, radiating a
                    power that even non-believers could feel in their bones.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Alistair was brought in to decipher the markings, expecting
                    nothing more than an academic challenge. But as he
                    translated the incantations, the air shimmered. The space
                    trembled.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Something answered back.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    A portal ripped open before him, revealing a place that
                    should not exist—an endless void filled with wraith-like
                    entities, beings of shadow and hunger, drawn to his
                    presence.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Instinctively, Alistair spoke the words written in the book,
                    the ones he had told himself were just mythology. Runes
                    burned into the air as power surged through him. The Bolts
                    of Balthakk lashed out, driving the creatures back. The
                    Mists of Munnopor swirled, obscuring their sight. In
                    desperation, he reached into the magic he had always studied
                    but never wielded, summoning a gateway back to his world—his
                    first true portal.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He survived. But something inside him had changed.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    His magical potential had awakened fully, no longer
                    theoretical, no longer academic. He had tapped into the
                    ancient forces of the universe, and they had answered.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A Scholar No More</strong><br />
                    Harvard no longer felt like home. The lecture halls and
                    libraries, once his sanctuary, now seemed small, limiting,
                    blind to the greater mysteries of existence. While his
                    colleagues debated historical theories, he had stared into
                    the abyss and fought what lurked beyond it.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He wasn’t just an occult scholar anymore. He was a sorcerer.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    But wielding magic meant more than just knowledge. It
                    required discipline. Responsibility. And most importantly,
                    purpose.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    When the Boston Avengers Academy reached out, it wasn’t
                    because they needed a warrior. It was because they needed a
                    teacher who could bridge the gap between science and
                    sorcery, someone who could train young heroes to wield magic
                    responsibly.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Alistair saw his new path clearly.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Runeweaver Rises</strong><br />
                    Taking on the name Runeweaver, Alistair became both a mentor
                    and a protector at BAA. He trained those with untapped
                    magical potential, ensuring they did not repeat the mistakes
                    of the past. He guided those who dabbled in the arcane,
                    ensuring they understood the price of power.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    As a member of Team Gamma, he wasn’t the bruiser or the
                    brawler. He was the strategist, the mystic anchor, the one
                    who could summon a portal at the last second, who could
                    cloak his team in illusions, who could bind an enemy with
                    eldritch energy before they even knew what had happened.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He brought more than just magic to the team—he brought
                    wisdom, the ability to see through deception, to plan for
                    what lurked beyond the material world. His presence made his
                    teammates think twice before acting rashly—because if
                    Runeweaver was worried, then something was truly wrong.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Scholar and the Sorcerer</strong><br />
                    Despite his place in BAA, Alistair never abandoned his
                    academic roots. He still lectures at Harvard, his course on
                    Occult and Mythological Studies is one of the most
                    mysterious and highly attended. Many assume his knowledge is
                    just historical.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Those who know better? They recognize the wards carved into
                    his office door, the artifacts sealed behind enchanted
                    glass, and the way shadows move just a little too
                    deliberately around him.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Alistair Graves once sought understanding. Now, he seeks
                    balance—between knowledge and power, magic and
                    responsibility, the world of men and the realms beyond.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Because some doors must never be opened. And some evils must
                    never return.
