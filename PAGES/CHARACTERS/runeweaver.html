                    <strong>The Weight of Knowledge</strong>  
                    Dr. Alistair Graves was born into a lineage of scholars and occultists. While his mother was an archaeologist, his father was something more—a practitioner of true magic. Alistair was raised in a world of forbidden knowledge and ancient power.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Ritual That Changed Everything</strong>  
                    While deciphering ancient symbols at an excavation site, Alistair accidentally triggered a portal to an unknown realm. Faced with wraith-like entities, he instinctively channeled forgotten spells, using magic he had only studied but never wielded. He survived—but he was forever changed.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A Scholar No More</strong>  
                    The lecture halls of Harvard no longer felt like home. He had seen beyond theory, into the heart of real magic. When the Boston Avengers Academy approached him, it wasn’t for his power—it was for his wisdom, his ability to guide those walking the dangerous path between knowledge and responsibility.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Runeweaver Rises</strong>  
                    Taking on the name Runeweaver, Alistair became both mentor and protector at BAA. He taught young heroes the dangers of unchecked magic, the importance of discipline, and the costs of power. In battle, he was the strategist—the one who cloaked allies in illusions, opened portals at the last second, and bound enemies in eldritch chains.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Scholar and the Sorcerer</strong>  
                    Though he fights alongside Team Gamma, Alistair remains a professor at Harvard. His Occult Studies course draws curious minds, but few realize the wards on his office doors and the artifacts locked behind enchanted glass are more than just historical relics.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Alistair Graves once sought knowledge. Now, he seeks balance—between learning and power, between the world of men and the realms beyond.  
                    Because some doors must never be opened. And some evils must never return.
