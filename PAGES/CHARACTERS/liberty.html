                    <strong>Amara Freeman</strong>'s ancestors fought in every
                    American conflict since the Revolutionary War. Her family
                    tree includes Buffalo Soldiers, Tuskegee Airmen, and civil
                    rights activists. This legacy of service ran deep in her
                    blood, but it was her grandmother Gloria's stories of
                    marching with Dr. King that resonated most strongly with
                    young Amara.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Growing up in Roxbury, Amara witnessed both community
                    strength and systemic inequalities. Her mother worked double
                    shifts as an ER nurse at Boston Medical Center, while her
                    father taught history at Roxbury Community College. They
                    raised Amara to understand that freedom required constant
                    vigilance and active participation.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Amara excelled in academics and athletics, earning a
                    scholarship to Northeastern University's Criminal Justice
                    program. She joined the boxing team, displaying a natural
                    talent that took her to collegiate championships. Professors
                    noted her fierce intelligence and unflinching moral compass,
                    marking her as a future leader in law enforcement.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Her life changed during her junior year when she interned
                    with the Boston Police Department. Responding to a domestic
                    violence call with her training officer, they found a woman
                    badly beaten by her politically connected husband. When the
                    officer received a call to "handle it quietly," Amara
                    refused to leave. The confrontation escalated when the
                    husband attacked them both.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    In that moment of crisis, something awakened in Amara. The
                    husband's punch connected with her jawâ€”but instead of pain,
                    she felt energy surge through her body. Acting on instinct,
                    she redirected the absorbed force in a counter-strike that
                    sent him flying across the room.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The incident was officially recorded as self-defense, but
                    questions about Amara's "excessive force" ended her
                    internship. More importantly, it sparked her journey to
                    understand her new abilities. She discovered she could
                    absorb kinetic energy from impacts and either redirect it
                    immediately or store it briefly to enhance her strength.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Disillusioned with the system but unwilling to abandon her
                    commitment to justice, Amara found purpose in community
                    organizing. She established a women's self-defense program
                    at her grandmother's church and volunteered with youth
                    outreach initiatives. During this period, she secretly
                    tested her powers, learning their limits and applications.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The turning point came when she stopped a bodega robbery in
                    progress. Using her abilities openly for the first time, she
                    disarmed three armed men without a single shot fired. News
                    of the "Roxbury Guardian" spread through community networks,
                    eventually reaching Samuel Revere, who was forming the
                    Minutemen.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Their first meeting was contentious. Amara questioned Sam's
                    understanding of the communities she sought to protect; he
                    challenged her lone-wolf approach. Their debate lasted
                    hours, ending with mutual respect and the foundation of a
                    partnership. Amara agreed to join the team on one condition:
                    they would fight for justice in all Boston neighborhoods,
                    not just the affluent ones.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    As Liberty, Amara serves as the Minutemen's moral center and
                    front-line fighter. Her kinetic absorption makes her nearly
                    untouchable in close combat, while her boxing background
                    gives her the technical skill to use that power efficiently.
                    Her specialized gauntlets, developed with Jackson's
                    engineering expertise, help her control and direct absorbed
                    energy with precision.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    When not in the field, Amara works as a youth counselor and
                    community advocate. This dual life lets her address both
                    immediate threats and underlying social issues. Her students
                    know her as the tough-but-fair mentor who pushes them toward
                    college and careers; only her teammates know she's the same
                    woman who dismantled a human trafficking ring operating near
                    a local high school.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Liberty leads by example, often taking the most dangerous
                    position in combat. Her teammates sometimes worry about her
                    tendency to absorb more punishment than necessary, seeing it
                    as both tactical advantage and personal penance for those
                    she couldn't help before becoming a hero. Despite this, she
                    remains the team's unwavering foundation, the one who
                    reminds them all what they're fighting for when missions
                    become complicated or compromises tempt them.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    "Freedom isn't just a concept," she often says during
                    training sessions. "It's something you have to earn every
                    single day."
