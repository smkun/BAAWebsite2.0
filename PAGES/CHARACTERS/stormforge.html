                    <strong>Born of Two Worlds</strong><br />
                    Sigrun Thorsson never truly belonged.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The blood of gods and warriors ran through his veins, yet he
                    was born on Midgard, raised among mortals who had long
                    forgotten the power of the old gods. His father, Hjalmar the
                    Storm-Blessed, was an Asgardian warrior of great renown, a
                    skald whose deeds were sung in the halls of Valhalla. His
                    mother, Ingrid Thorsson, was a mortal—a woman of fire and
                    steel, a descendant of Viking warriors who had once raised
                    their blades to the heavens in defiance of the gods
                    themselves.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Hjalmar and Ingrid’s love was brief but fierce, a story of
                    passion and fate entwined for a single moment before the
                    tides of war pulled Hjalmar back to Asgard. He left behind a
                    son destined for greater things—but Sigrun grew up with no
                    knowledge of his divine lineage, raised by his mother in the
                    cold winds of Norway, where the sea roared like an angry god
                    and the mountains whispered forgotten names.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    From the moment he could walk, Sigrun was different. He was
                    stronger than the other children, faster, unbreakable in
                    ways that defied explanation. His mother never questioned
                    it, never treated him like anything but her son, though she
                    whispered old Norse prayers when she thought he wasn’t
                    listening.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Then, on his eighteenth winter, the truth arrived in the
                    form of thunder and war.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Battle That Woke the Storm</strong><br />
                    Sigrun’s village was not unknown to the supernatural. Beings
                    of shadow and chaos had long sought forgotten corners of
                    Midgard to plot their return. The Jötunn, the ancient
                    enemies of Asgard, had taken an interest in him—not for who
                    he was, but for what he could become.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    They came at night, shrouded in ice and malice. Their
                    leader, a frost-forged warlord known as Hrothvek the Bitter,
                    sought to crush the Asgardian bloodline before it could rise
                    again. They did not expect resistance.
                </p>
                <p class="text">They did not expect Sigrun.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    The battle was short and brutal. Sigrun, armed only with a
                    simple axe and his bare fists, fought like a force of
                    nature. He moved with an instinct no mortal should possess,
                    his strength overwhelming, his body unyielding even to the
                    enchanted weapons of the Jötunn raiders. His rage burned
                    hotter than the ice, his berserker fury igniting something
                    ancient within him—something that even he did not
                    understand.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Then, the heavens split open.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    Lightning roared. Thunder cracked the sky. And from the
                    storm descended Thor, the God of Thunder himself.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    With a single swing of Mjolnir, the Jötunn warband was
                    obliterated, scattered like snow before a hurricane.
                    Hrothvek fled, vowing vengeance. And Sigrun, still breathing
                    hard, his fists bloodied, turned to face the cousin he never
                    knew he had.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Gift of Tempest’s Fang</strong><br />
                    Thor did not offer explanations—only truths.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Sigrun was Asgardian by blood, a distant heir to the warrior
                    legacies of old. His power was his birthright, but it was
                    raw, untamed, lacking the discipline of true Asgardian
                    warriors. If left unchecked, it would consume him, turning
                    him into a beast of battle rather than a force of honor.
                </p>
                <p class="text">But Thor saw something worthy in him.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    From his side, he drew a weapon not seen on Midgard in
                    centuries—Tempest’s Fang, a blade forged in the heart of a
                    thunderstorm, once wielded by an Asgardian warlord whose
                    name had long been erased from history.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    "This blade is no heirloom,” Thor told him, placing it in
                    his hands. “It is a challenge. Wield it well and prove that
                    your heart is stronger than your rage.”
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Then, he made another decree—Sigrun would train at the
                    Boston Avengers Academy, where he could learn to master his
                    abilities, to temper his fury, to become something more than
                    a warrior—something worthy of legend.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Becoming Stormforge</strong><br />
                    BAA was not what Sigrun expected. He was a warrior among
                    tacticians, a brawler among strategists, a god-born among
                    mortals. The rules of Midgard’s heroes conflicted with the
                    instincts that ran deep in his blood. He did not understand
                    restraint, careful planning, or the idea that some fights
                    were not meant to be won with brute force.
                </p>
                <p class="text">But the Academy changed him.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    He trained harder than anyone, pushing his body past limits
                    even Asgardians thought impossible. He fought alongside
                    mutants, soldiers, scientists, and mystics, learning not
                    just how to swing a blade, but when not to. His berserker
                    fury, once a reckless storm, became a controlled
                    tempest—unleashed only when the moment demanded it.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He took the name Stormforge, a reminder that he was not
                    simply a weapon, but a warrior shaped by both storm and
                    fire.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    With Tempest’s Fang in hand, he fights not for the glory of
                    Asgard, not for the pride of his bloodline, but for his own
                    honor, his own purpose, and the people who now stand beside
                    him.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A Legacy Yet to Be Written</strong><br />
                    Thor still watches, waiting to see if Sigrun will forge his
                    own legend or be consumed by the fire within him. The Jötunn
                    still hunt him, knowing that his blood carries a power they
                    fear. And deep within his soul, the battle between man and
                    god rages on.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    But one thing is certain—when Stormforge enters the fight,
                    the thunder rolls, and the storm is coming.
