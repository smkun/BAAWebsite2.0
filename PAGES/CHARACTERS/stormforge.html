                    <strong>Born of Two Worlds</strong>  
                    Sigrun Thorsson was raised as a mortal, unaware of his Asgardian heritage. His father, Hjalmar the Storm-Blessed, was a legendary warrior, while his mother, Ingrid Thorsson, was a descendant of Viking warriors. He always felt different, stronger—until the truth was revealed.

                    <strong>The Battle That Woke the Storm</strong>  
                    When Jötunn warlord Hrothvek the Bitter attacked his village, Sigrun fought with unexplainable strength. His rage ignited something ancient within him—then the skies split open, and Thor himself descended, obliterating the enemy. That night, Sigrun learned he was of Asgardian blood.

                    <strong>The Gift of Tempest’s Fang</strong>  
                    Thor did not just acknowledge Sigrun—he challenged him. Handing him Tempest’s Fang, an ancient blade forged in a thunderstorm, Thor told him to prove himself worthy. To train, to control his power, and to forge his own legend.

                    <strong>Becoming Stormforge</strong>  
                    At Boston Avengers Academy, Sigrun struggled to adapt. He was a warrior among tacticians, a god-born among mortals. But through discipline, training, and the guidance of his team, he learned that strength was not just about power—it was about control.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A Legacy Yet to Be Written</strong>  
                    The Jötunn still hunt him. Thor still watches. And the battle within himself rages on. But one thing is certain—when Stormforge enters the fight, the thunder rolls, and the storm is coming.
