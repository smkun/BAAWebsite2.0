                    <strong>Chapter 1: The First Responder</strong><br />
                    Connor Flanagan followed his father and grandfather into the
                    Boston Fire Department, serving at Engine Company 28 in
                    Jamaica Plain. His unit specialized in hazardous materials
                    response, with Connor leading the first-entry team. His
                    methodical approach and calmness under pressure contrasted
                    with the department's more aggressive hotshots.

                    <strong>Chapter 2: The Chemical Crucible</strong><br />
                    The call came at 3 AM – a massive fire at a chemical
                    research facility near the harbor. Multiple companies
                    responded, including Engine 28 and Engine 41 from East
                    Boston. Initial reports indicated experimental compounds
                    were involved. Connor led his team through the south
                    entrance, coordinating with hazmat protocols while Engine
                    41's Lester McBurney took his team through the loading dock.

                <p class="text">
                    A catastrophic explosion rocked the facility as the teams
                    converged. Caustic chemicals mixed with firefighting water,
                    creating an impossible reaction. As consciousness faded,
                    Connor noticed the water around him moving with unusual
                    purpose, forming a protective cocoon. Through blurred
                    vision, he saw similar water patterns surrounding McBurney
                    across the room.

                    <strong>Chapter 3: Immersion</strong><br />
                    Connor woke in Massachusetts General's burn unit three days
                    later, in a room with McBurney. The doctors couldn't explain
                    how either man survived the chemical exposure. During
                    recovery, both discovered they could manipulate water,
                    though in markedly different ways. Connor developed precise
                    control, able to guide water with surgical accuracy.
                    McBurney manifested raw power, able to generate massive
                    pressure and force.

                <p class="text">
                    Connor's paramedic training helped him understand his
                    emerging healing abilities. He learned to use water as an
                    extension of his medical knowledge, accelerating natural
                    healing processes through hydrokinetic manipulation.
                    Meanwhile, McBurney focused on offensive applications,
                    developing techniques for high-pressure water projection.

                    <strong>Chapter 4: Rising Tide</strong><br />
                    Their first joint rescue came during a bridge collapse.
                    Connor used precise water control to stabilize victims and
                    create protective barriers, while McBurney's powerful water
                    blasts cleared heavy debris. Their complementary abilities
                    caught Iron Man's attention, who recognized the value of
                    having two differently-skilled water controllers.

                    The Boston Fire Department supported both men's transition
                    to the Boston Avengers Academy, seeing the benefit of
                    enhanced emergency response capabilities that covered both
                    precision and power. They maintained their firefighter
                    status while training, responding to major incidents in both
                    capacities.

                    <strong>Chapter 5: The Flow of Heroes</strong><br />
                    At BAA, Connor and McBurney developed their partnership
                    despite contrasting styles. Connor's calm precision balanced
                    McBurney's aggressive power, making them an effective team
                    during crisis response. They often train together, combining
                    their abilities in new ways to handle various emergency
                    scenarios.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Connor transformed his department's turnout gear into a
                    specialized costume, incorporating hydration systems and
                    medical supplies. The burn scars on his arm remind him of
                    that transformative night at the chemical facility, driving
                    him to master his water manipulation and healing abilities.

                    <strong>Present Day</strong><br />
                    His quarters at BAA resemble a paramedic's ready room, a
                    stark contrast to McBurney's sparse setup next door. He runs
                    first aid training for other heroes and maintains
                    certification as a hazmat specialist between missions. His
                    experience helps bridge the gap between conventional
                    emergency services and superhuman response teams.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Despite their enhanced abilities, both men remain
                    firefighters at heart. They approach heroics
                    differently—Connor with methodical discipline, McBurney with
                    raw power—but share an unwavering commitment to saving
                    lives. The department still calls both for significant
                    fires, where their contrasting water manipulation styles
                    prove invaluable for containment and rescue. Together as
                    Floodline and 9-Alarm, they represent the evolution of
                    emergency response, combining traditional firefighting with
                    complementary superhuman capabilities to protect Boston from
                    any threat.
