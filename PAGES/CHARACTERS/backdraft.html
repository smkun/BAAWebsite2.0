                <p class="text">
                    Daniel “Danny” Calloway grew up with the firehouse in his
                    blood. His father was a firefighter, his uncle was a
                    firefighter, and his grandfather had been a firefighter
                    before them. The Calloways were a Boston institution,
                    serving in the fire department for three generations. Their
                    legacy was built on battle scars, close calls, and lives
                    saved.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Danny never questioned what he would be when he grew up. He
                    spent his childhood running drills in the backyard, learning
                    how to roll hose lines and don turnout gear faster than most
                    rookies. By sixteen, he was volunteering at the local
                    firehouse, watching his father, Ray Calloway, lead Engine 54
                    with the same fearless determination that had kept their
                    family name etched into the city’s history.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    But Ray Calloway didn’t want his son following in his
                    footsteps. He had seen too many good men burn, too many
                    families left grieving. “Find another way to help people,
                    kid,” he told Danny again and again. “Because in this job,
                    you don’t always make it home.”
                </p>
                <p class="text">Danny didn’t listen.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Into the Fire</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He graduated high school and enlisted straight into the
                    academy, becoming a full-fledged firefighter at twenty-one.
                    He wasn’t just another name on the roster—he was good,
                    earning a spot as a smokejumper, one of the elite few
                    trained to parachute into wildfires where ground crews
                    couldn’t reach. It was dangerous work, but Danny thrived in
                    it. He loved the adrenaline, the challenge, the high-stakes
                    rush of beating the flames before they swallowed everything
                    whole.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Then came the call that changed everything.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    A forest fire in western Massachusetts had spread faster
                    than expected, cutting off escape routes for a trapped fire
                    crew. Danny and his team were air-dropped into the inferno,
                    tasked with cutting a path to get them out. The wind
                    shifted. The flames surged. Within minutes, they were
                    surrounded.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The heat was unbearable, searing the air in his lungs, his
                    vision blurring from the suffocating smoke. He could hear
                    his team yelling, trapped in the blaze. He knew he had
                    seconds before it was over.
                </p>
                <p class="text">And then the fire stopped burning him.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    Danny’s body absorbed the heat instead of succumbing to it.
                    The flames that should have consumed him wrapped around him
                    like a living shield, their energy flooding into his veins
                    rather than reducing him to ash. He felt lighter, stronger,
                    untouched by the firestorm around him. With a surge of
                    instinct, he extended his hands—and the flames pushed
                    outward, blasting away from his teammates like a controlled
                    explosion.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The fire didn’t kill them. Danny controlled it.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A Firefighter Reforged</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Rescue crews found him standing in the middle of the
                    burned-out clearing, his gear scorched but his skin
                    untouched. The men he saved called it a miracle. The
                    department called it impossible.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The tests came next, weeks of medical scans, government
                    officials asking questions, and scientists poking and
                    prodding. His mutation had always been there, dormant until
                    the right moment forced it awake. His body could absorb heat
                    and flames, redirecting them like a controlled explosion. He
                    was fireproof, able to control the very element he had spent
                    his life fighting.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The department didn’t know what to do with him. Some saw him
                    as an unstoppable asset, others as a walking hazard. His
                    father barely spoke to him. The man who had spent his life
                    warning Danny about the dangers of fire now had a son who
                    could command it at will.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Then came the offer from the Boston Avengers Academy.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Brotherhood of the Flame</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Danny wasn’t the first firefighter to develop powers. Connor
                    Flanagan (Floodline) and Lester McBurney (9-Alarm) had
                    already found their way to BAA, their abilities tied to the
                    same chemical fire that changed them forever. They reached
                    out to him first—not as recruiters, but as brothers-in-arms,
                    men who knew what it meant to carry the weight of both duty
                    and power.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Danny resisted at first. He wasn’t a superhero—he was a
                    firefighter. He didn’t want to punch supervillains or join
                    some costumed circus. He wanted to be in the field, helping
                    people the way he always had.
                </p>
                <p class="text">But that was exactly why they wanted him.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    At BAA, he could learn to control his powers, to wield them
                    with precision instead of instinct. He wasn’t being asked to
                    stop being a firefighter. He was being asked to become the
                    best version of one.
                </p>
                <p class="text">So he agreed.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Fire That Fights Back</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    At the Academy, Danny earned the name Backdraft—a nod to the
                    deadly phenomenon where fire surges back into an area when
                    new oxygen is introduced. It was fitting. He wasn’t just a
                    man who survived the flames—he became part of them, turning
                    their destructive force into something controlled, precise,
                    and unstoppable.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Training wasn’t easy. He had to learn how to focus his
                    blasts, how to generate fire without it spiraling out of
                    control. Floodline taught him how to regulate the
                    temperature of his flames, while 9-Alarm pushed him to use
                    his abilities offensively in combat situations. They fought,
                    argued, and bonded like only firefighters could.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    And despite everything, Danny never stopped being one of
                    them.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Even as a member of Team Gamma, even as he trained alongside
                    people who could reshape the earth and dodge bullets before
                    they were fired, he still answered the call when the alarm
                    rang. When a building collapsed under a supervillain’s
                    rampage, when a wildfire threatened to consume an entire
                    neighborhood, when people needed saving in the middle of an
                    inferno, he was the first one in.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Because firefighter or hero, some things never change.
