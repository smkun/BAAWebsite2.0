                    <strong>Fire in the Blood</strong><br />
                    Lester McBurney came from three generations of Boston
                    firefighters. He served at Engine Company 41 in East Boston,
                    where his aggressive tactics and willingness to push limits
                    earned him a reputation as a hotshot. His fellow
                    firefighters admired his courage, while supervisors worried
                    about his tendency to bend protocols.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Point of No Return</strong><br />
                    The chemical facility fire brought multiple companies to the
                    harbor. While Engine 28's team approached from the south
                    entrance, Lester led Engine 41 through the loading dock. He
                    ignored orders to wait for hazmat approval, convinced
                    victims were trapped inside.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The chemical explosion caught both teams. Lester experienced
                    a strange connection to the liquid around him as deadly
                    compounds mixed with firefighting water. His body absorbed
                    the contaminated water, transforming it into pure force.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Raw Power</strong><br />
                    Lester woke in Massachusetts General's burn unit beside
                    Connor Flanagan from Engine 28. Both had survived impossible
                    chemical exposure. During recovery, Lester discovered he
                    could project high-pressure water blasts and generate
                    protective barriers.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Unlike Flanagan's precise control, Lester's powers
                    manifested as raw force. He could unleash devastating water
                    pressure but struggled with fine manipulation. His enhanced
                    strength and reflexes complemented his aggressive
                    firefighting style.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Baptism by Fire</strong><br />
                    His first post-accident response came during a warehouse
                    blaze. Lester charged in, using water blasts to clear
                    burning debris and create escape routes. His forceful
                    approach contrasted with Flanagan's methodical rescue
                    techniques, but both proved effective in their own way.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The Boston Fire Department recognized the value of having
                    two enhanced firefighters with complementary styles. They
                    supported both joining the Boston Avengers Academy, seeing
                    them as a bridge between conventional and superhuman
                    emergency response.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Trial by Water</strong><br />
                    At BAA, Lester's brash attitude clashed with traditional
                    training methods. Yet his frontline experience and raw power
                    earned respect. He formed an unlikely partnership with
                    Flanagan—one methodical, one aggressive, but both dedicated
                    to saving lives.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He modified his turnout gear with reinforced plating to
                    handle his water pressure powers. The department still calls
                    him for major fires, where his ability to deliver massive
                    water volume proves invaluable for containment.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    His quarters at BAA reflect his personality—sparse but
                    functional, with firefighting gear always ready. He
                    maintains close ties with Engine 41, often training with
                    regular firefighters to stay grounded in conventional
                    techniques.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Despite his enhanced abilities, Lester remains the same
                    adrenaline-seeking hotshot who charged into that chemical
                    fire. His powers give him new ways to be aggressive in
                    pursuit of saving lives. As "9-Alarm," he represents the raw
                    power of emergency response, complementing Floodline's
                    precision to protect Boston from any threat, mundane or
                    extraordinary.
