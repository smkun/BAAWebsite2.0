                    <strong>Fire in the Blood</strong> Lester McBurney came from
                    three generations of Boston firefighters. He served at
                    Engine Company 41 in East Boston, where his aggressive
                    tactics and willingness to push limits earned him a
                    reputation as a hotshot. His fellow firefighters admired his
                    courage, while supervisors worried about his tendency to
                    bend protocols.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Point of No Return</strong> The chemical facility
                    fire brought multiple companies to the harbor. While Engine
                    28's team approached from the south entrance, Lester led
                    Engine 41 through the loading dock. He ignored orders to
                    wait for hazmat approval, convinced victims were trapped
                    inside.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The chemical explosion caught both teams. Lester experienced
                    a strange connection to the liquid around him as deadly
                    compounds mixed with firefighting water. His body absorbed
                    the contaminated water, transforming it into pure force.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Raw Power</strong> Lester woke in Massachusetts
                    General's burn unit beside Connor Flanagan from Engine 28.
                    Both had survived impossible chemical exposure. During
                    recovery, Lester discovered he could project high-pressure
                    water blasts and generate protective barriers.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Unlike Flanagan's precise control, Lester's powers
                    manifested as raw force. He could unleash devastating water
                    pressure but struggled with fine manipulation. His enhanced
                    strength and reflexes complemented his aggressive
                    firefighting style.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Baptism by Fire</strong> His first post-accident
                    response came during a warehouse blaze. Lester charged in,
                    using water blasts to clear burning debris and create escape
                    routes. His forceful approach contrasted with Flanagan's
                    methodical rescue techniques, but both proved effective in
                    their own way.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The Boston Fire Department recognized the value of having
                    two enhanced firefighters with complementary styles. They
                    supported both joining the Boston Avengers Academy, seeing
                    them as a bridge between conventional and superhuman
                    emergency response.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Trial by Water</strong> At BAA, Lester's brash
                    attitude clashed with traditional training methods. Yet his
                    front-line experience and raw power earned respect. He
                    formed an unlikely partnership with Flanagan - one
                    methodical, one aggressive, but both dedicated to saving
                    lives.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    He modified his turnout gear with reinforced plating to
                    handle his water pressure powers. The department still calls
                    him for major fires, where his ability to deliver massive
                    water volume proves invaluable for containment.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His quarters at BAA reflect his personality - sparse but
                    functional, with firefighting gear always ready. He
                    maintains close ties with Engine 41, often training with
                    regular firefighters to stay grounded in conventional
                    techniques.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Despite his enhanced abilities, Lester remains the same
                    adrenaline-seeking hotshot who charged into that chemical
                    fire. His powers give him new ways to be aggressive in
                    pursuit of saving lives. As "9-Alarm," he represents the raw
                    power of emergency response, complementing Floodline's
                    precision to protect Boston from any threat, mundane or
                    extraordinary.
