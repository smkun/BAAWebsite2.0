                    <strong>A Family of Builders</strong>  
                    Gabriel “Gabe” Ortega grew up between three influences—his father, a construction foreman; his mother, a teacher; and his grandfather, a man who saw the land as something sacred. While his brothers pursued law and engineering, Gabe’s passion was the earth itself.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Fall That Changed Everything</strong>  
                    Studying seismic activity in California, Gabe was caught in a sudden earthquake. He fell into darkness—but instead of being crushed, the earth responded to him. He pushed, and the ground obeyed. When he emerged, the canyon had reshaped itself around him.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Call from Boston</strong>  
                    MIT geophysics professor Dr. Malcolm Raines recognized what had happened and reached out. He warned Gabe that his abilities weren’t just power—they were a fault line running through him. He needed training before disaster struck.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Finding His Place</strong>  
                    At Boston Avengers Academy, Gabe initially struggled to fit in. He wasn’t drawn to combat like others on Team Gamma, fearing the destruction his abilities could cause. Over time, he realized his strength wasn’t about force—it was about stability, about being the anchor his team could rely on.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Weight of Expectations</strong>  
                    His family had mixed feelings—his mother wanted him to use his degree, his brothers worried about the risks. Only his grandfather understood. “The land chose you,” he told Gabe. “It doesn’t do that without reason.”
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Gabe never sought to be a hero, but when the ground trembled and people needed him, he stood firm. He was Groundbreak, the unshakable force that held the line when everything else fell apart.
