                    <strong>The Builder's Path</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Sarah Chen grew up in her family's auto repair shop in
                    Dorchester, where she learned mechanics from her mother, a
                    former Boeing engineer. She showed an early talent for
                    understanding load-bearing systems, often sketching
                    improvements to car suspension designs between repair jobs.
                    Her innovative hydraulic control systems helped her high
                    school robotics team win state championships.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    MIT recruited her with a full scholarship to their
                    mechanical engineering program. She focused on advanced
                    materials and power systems, developing new approaches to
                    force multiplication in mechanical systems. Her
                    undergraduate thesis on "Dynamic Load Distribution in
                    Powered Frameworks" caught the attention of both military
                    contractors and Stark Industries.

                    <strong>The Atlas Project</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    After graduating, Sarah joined a small defense contractor in
                    Cambridge, working on exoskeletons for medical
                    rehabilitation. She identified fundamental flaws in existing
                    powered armor designs—they focused too much on weapons and
                    speed and not enough on core structural integrity.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The Atlas Frame emerged from her research into construction
                    equipment. Rather than copying humanoid movement, she
                    designed a system that distributed force through an
                    engineered lattice, like modern skyscraper support
                    structures. The result: unprecedented lifting capacity with
                    lower power requirements.

                    <strong>Trial by Fire</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The Prudential Tower crisis proved Atlas Frame's worth. When
                    structural damage threatened the building's collapse, Sarah
                    used her prototype to support a failing support column while
                    rescue teams evacuated trapped civilians. The suit performed
                    beyond specifications, holding up tons of concrete for over
                    three hours.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The incident revealed both strengths and limitations. The
                    Frame's power systems overheated but never failed. Its
                    structural integrity exceeded theoretical limits, but
                    mobility suffered under extreme loads. Most importantly, it
                    demonstrated the value of defensive engineering over
                    offensive capabilities.

                    <strong>The Academy Calls</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Iron Man recommended Sarah for BAA after reviewing the Atlas
                    Frame's performance data. The Academy offered resources to
                    refine her design while training her as a hero. She
                    accepted, seeing an opportunity to prove that engineering
                    could match innate powers in effectiveness.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    At BAA, Sarah expanded the Atlas Frame's capabilities. She
                    developed modular systems to adapt to different mission
                    requirements while maintaining the core focus on strength
                    and protection. The suit's signature became its ability to
                    serve as mobile cover for teammates, creating defensive
                    positions in any environment.

                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    As Bulwark, Sarah fills the heavy support role on Team Beta.
                    The Atlas Frame's defensive capabilities complement DEX797's
                    offensive focus while providing protection for more
                    vulnerable teammates. She excels at rescue operations,
                    structural support, and holding tactical positions.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    She maintains a workshop at BAA where she constantly refines
                    the Atlas Frame. Current projects include:
                </p>
                <ul class="text">
                    <li>Enhanced thermal management for extended operations</li>
                    <li>Modular armor plates for different threat types</li>
                    <li>Improved power distribution systems</li>
                    <li>Integration with BAA tactical networks</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text">
                    The suit's limitations become part of her tactical approach.
                    She plans operations around power consumption rates and
                    structural load limits, turning engineering constraints into
                    strategic considerations. Her engineering background helps
                    her coordinate with DEX797 on technical issues, while her
                    practical experience connects her with Floodline's
                    first-responder perspective.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Sarah still helps at her family's shop on weekends, using
                    the work to inspire improvements to the Atlas Frame. She
                    views the suit as a continual work in progress, each mission
                    providing data for future enhancements. Her quarters at BAA
                    double as a technical library, filled with engineering
                    references and design simulations.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    As Bulwark, she represents a different path to heroism—one
                    built on engineering principles and mechanical innovation
                    rather than innate powers or mystical abilities. The Atlas
                    Frame proves that human ingenuity can create heroes through
                    technology and determination.
