                    <strong>Darius Greene</strong> grew up where concrete met
                    soil. His home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood faced a
                    small community garden his mother had fought to establish
                    amid urban development. While other children played video
                    games, Darius spent hours with his hands in the earth,
                    coaxing life from seemingly barren ground.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His mother, Dr. Elaine Greene, was a renowned ethnobotanist
                    who studied traditional plant knowledge across cultures. His
                    father, Marcus Greene, worked as a community organizer
                    focused on environmental justice. Their influences shaped
                    Darius into a passionate advocate for green spaces in urban
                    environments.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His academic path seemed predictable – high school
                    valedictorian, full scholarship to study environmental
                    science at Boston University, research positions focused on
                    urban agriculture. What his professors didn't know was that
                    Darius had developed an uncommon connection with plant life.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    It started subtly during his freshman year. Plants in his
                    dorm room grew at accelerated rates. The community garden
                    plots he maintained produced yields that defied explanation.
                    He discovered he could sense plant distress at increasing
                    distances, feeling their need for water or sunlight as
                    physical sensations in his own body.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The catalyst for his full awakening came during a protest
                    against the destruction of Mattapan's last significant green
                    space for a luxury development. As bulldozers approached the
                    centuries-old oak that anchored the ecosystem, Darius placed
                    himself in their path. In that moment of crisis, dormant
                    abilities fully emerged – vines erupted from the ground to
                    entangle the machinery, roots reinforced themselves against
                    disruption, and Darius found himself connected to every
                    plant in the vicinity.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The incident was captured on dozens of cell phones. While
                    authorities investigated, Darius went underground, supported
                    by a network of environmental activists. During this period,
                    he refined his abilities, learning to communicate with
                    plants at a molecular level and direct their growth with
                    increasing precision.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Samuel Revere, already organizing the Minutemen, tracked
                    Darius through mutual connections in Boston's scientific
                    community. Rather than approaching directly, Sam arranged a
                    meeting through Darius's mother, who had suspected her son's
                    enhanced abilities long before they manifested publicly.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Their conversation lasted through the night. By morning,
                    Darius had agreed to join the team, seeing an opportunity to
                    protect both Boston's people and its fragile urban
                    ecosystems. His one condition: the team would incorporate
                    environmental protection into its mission.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    As Greenway, Darius brings scientific expertise and
                    versatile plant-based abilities to the Minutemen. In combat,
                    he can grow barriers of thick vegetation, create entangling
                    vines to subdue opponents, or produce specialized plant
                    compounds with medicinal or defensive properties. His
                    connection with Boston's urban flora provides an extensive
                    surveillance network – trees that "remember" conversations
                    held beneath them, roots that detect underground movements,
                    flowers that respond to chemical changes in the air.

                <p class="text">
                    His equipment enhances these natural abilities. Specialized
                    seed pouches contain rapid-growing species from around the
                    world. Modified plant hormones accelerate growth in
                    emergency situations. His lightweight armor incorporates
                    living plant material that strengthens in response to
                    impact.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Darius maintains his academic career as cover, now working
                    as a research fellow at Boston University's Urban Ecology
                    Department. This position provides access to laboratories
                    and scientific resources while allowing him to monitor
                    environmental threats to the city. His research on
                    pollution-resistant plants has earned recognition in
                    academic circles, though colleagues wonder why promising
                    experiments sometimes disappear from his lab.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Within the team, Darius often partners with Harbormaster on
                    environmental missions, their water and plant abilities
                    creating powerful synergies. He serves as the team's medic,
                    his plant-based healing particularly effective for Liberty,
                    whose kinetic absorption often leaves her with internal
                    injuries.

                <p class="text">
                    "Plants have been healing the world for billions of years,"
                    he reminds his teammates during training. "We're just
                    learning to ask them properly."
