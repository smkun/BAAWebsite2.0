                    <strong>The Pursuit of Perfection</strong>  
                    Jacob “Jake” Mercer was never the strongest, the fastest, or the toughest. But what he lacked in raw power, he made up for with an insatiable mind.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Jake grew up obsessed with the boundaries of human potential. His parents were top-level scientists, and he followed in their footsteps, driven to push past the limits of biology. By twenty, he was a Ph.D. candidate at MIT, part of a classified government-backed research initiative known as Project Apex.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Experiment Gone Wrong</strong>  
                    Jake wasn’t just a researcher—he was his own test subject. When he injected himself with an experimental biochemical serum, his body went into overdrive. His mind burned with overwhelming knowledge, his cells mutating, adapting faster than he could process. He gained the ability to sense and manipulate the energy fields of living things—enhancing, suppressing, or even copying their abilities.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Running from the Lab</strong>  
                    Project Apex didn’t see him as a scientist anymore—they saw him as an asset. When security forces came to contain him, his instincts kicked in. He moved before they could act, his body adapting in real-time. Using his new abilities, he escaped into the streets of Boston, hunted by those who wanted their prototype back.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Academy’s Offer</strong>  
                    With nowhere to go, Jake found himself at the Boston Avengers Academy. They had been monitoring Project Apex and saw him as a mind too valuable to lose and a power too dangerous to be left unchecked. Given the choice between running forever or learning to control what he had become, he chose the Academy.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Becoming Catalyst</strong>  
                    At BAA, he took on the codename Catalyst. He wasn’t the strongest, but he was the most adaptable. His abilities allowed him to heal injuries, amplify powers, copy abilities, and even neutralize threats before they spiraled out of control.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Scientist, Not the Weapon</strong>  
                    Despite everything, Jake never forgot why he started this journey. He wasn’t a soldier. He wasn’t a lab rat. He was a scientist, and he was determined to stop Project Apex from creating something even more dangerous.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The world didn’t need more super-soldiers. It needed someone to break the cycle.  
                    And he was ready to be the catalyst for that change.
