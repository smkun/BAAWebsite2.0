                    <strong>A Mind Built for Discovery</strong>  
                    Dr. Elias Vance was raised in a family of scientists, obsessed with understanding the brain. By twenty-two, he had a doctorate in neural network modeling, pushing the boundaries of human cognition.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Experiment That Changed Everything</strong>  
                    While testing a neural interface at NeuroCore Labs, Elias’s brainwaves expanded beyond the system, giving him direct access to the thoughts and emotions of those around him. The accident rewrote his mind—unlocking abilities beyond human comprehension.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Awakening the Mind</strong>  
                    Now, Elias could read minds, absorb knowledge instantly, and move objects with sheer thought. But his abilities were unstable—NeuroCore wanted to contain him, the government wanted to control him. He had no choice but to run.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Mind Meets the Academy</strong>  
                    With the help of Cipher, Elias escaped to the Boston Avengers Academy. They didn’t see him as a weapon—they saw him as a person who needed guidance. He took on the name Synapse, a symbol of his new path.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Mastering the Mind’s Potential</strong>  
                    At BAA, Synapse became the team’s strategist, coordinating movements telepathically, uploading knowledge directly into his allies’ minds. He developed neural dampeners to regulate his abilities, ensuring he didn’t hear too much.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Mind Never Rests</strong>  
                    His power comes with a cost—the more he reads minds, the harder it is to stay detached. But his team keeps him grounded, reminding him that he is more than just a supercomputer with telekinesis. He may not have chosen this life, but now that he’s here, he’s going to master it.
