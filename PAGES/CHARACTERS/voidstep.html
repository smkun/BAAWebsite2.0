                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Temple's Edge</strong> Todo Aoi grew up in a
                    remote temple outside Kyoto, training in martial arts under
                    his grandfather, a master of an ancient fighting style
                    combining meditation and movement. The temple sat at a nexus
                    point of mystical energies, though Todo remained unaware of
                    its significance through his childhood.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His natural aptitude for martial arts manifested in two
                    distinct ways - an ability to read and counter opponents'
                    movements, and moments where he seemed to move through space
                    in impossible ways during sparring matches.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Sorcerer's Eye</strong> Doctor Strange first
                    sensed Todo's potential during an astral survey of mystical
                    nexus points. He observed the young martial artist
                    unconsciously tapping into dimensional energies during his
                    training, combining them with his fighting techniques.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The Ancient One's scrolls spoke of warrior-mages who could
                    step between dimensions in combat, but the technique had
                    been lost for centuries. Todo's natural ability to merge
                    martial arts with dimensional manipulation marked him as a
                    potential heir to this legacy.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Awakening</strong> Strange arranged to visit the
                    temple, arriving as Todo experienced his first conscious
                    teleport during an intensive training session. Pushed to his
                    limits, Todo instinctively merged his defensive stance with
                    a dimensional step, vanishing from before an attack and
                    appearing behind his sparring partner.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The temple's mystic energies surged in response, awakening
                    Todo's latent magical abilities. His martial arts forms
                    began incorporating short-range teleports, his body flowing
                    through space as naturally as through stances.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Path Between</strong> Under Strange's guidance,
                    Todo learned to control his unique fusion of magic and
                    martial arts. His defensive techniques evolved to include
                    dimensional displacement, while his attacks incorporated
                    teleportation to strike from unexpected angles.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His signature "Void Step" technique emerged from combining
                    his blink ability with traditional counter-attacks. By
                    reading an opponent's movement and teleporting in response,
                    he could turn their own force against them through
                    reverse-momentum throws.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Academy's Halls</strong> Strange sponsored
                    Todo's admission to BAA, recognizing he needed both mystical
                    and superhero training. The Academy's controlled environment
                    let him refine his abilities without risking dimensional
                    instability.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Todo's training focuses on combining his powers in new ways:
                    Chain strikes executed through multiple teleports, defense
                    stances enhanced by spatial manipulation, and rapid attack
                    sequences using blink barrage to overwhelm opponents.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Present Day</strong> Todo maintains a strict
                    training regimen at BAA, practicing his martial arts forms
                    in the early morning hours. His quarters feature a small
                    meditation space where he studies mystical texts provided by
                    Strange.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    He serves as a bridge between the Academy's conventional
                    combat instructors and mystical mentors, helping other
                    students understand how different power types can complement
                    each other. His ability to swap places with allies during
                    combat makes him a valuable training partner for new
                    recruits learning team tactics.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The other students often find him in the Academy's
                    meditation garden, moving through forms that seem to bend
                    space around him. His calm demeanor masks the intensity of
                    his training, as he works to perfect the integration of
                    martial arts and dimensional magic.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His presence at BAA represents a revival of an ancient
                    mystical combat tradition, combining the discipline of
                    martial arts with the power of dimensional manipulation.
                    While still learning to master his abilities, he embodies
                    the potential for merging physical and mystical combat
                    techniques in new ways.

                    Ancient scrolls in Todo's temple spoke of a weapon forged at
                    dimensional crossroads - a sanjiegun split between realities
                    by mystic smiths. Dr. Strange recovered its scattered
                    pieces, sensing their resonance with Todo's abilities. Each
                    section holds memories of different dimensions, letting Todo
                    channel his teleportation powers through the weapon's
                    ancient magic.

                <p class="text">
                    The +2 damage comes from the weapon striking through
                    multiple dimensional planes simultaneously. In combat, blue
                    energy ripples mark its path through space.
