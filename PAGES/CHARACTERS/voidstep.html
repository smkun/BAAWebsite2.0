                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Temple's Edge</strong>
                    Todo Aoi grew up in a remote temple outside Kyoto, training
                    in martial arts under his grandfather, a master of an
                    ancient fighting style combining meditation and movement.
                    The temple sat at a nexus point of mystical energies, though
                    Todo remained unaware of its significance through his
                    childhood.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    His natural aptitude for martial arts manifested in two
                    distinct ways—an ability to read and counter opponents'
                    movements, and moments where he seemed to move through space
                    in impossible ways during sparring matches.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Sorcerer's Eye</strong>
                    Doctor Strange first sensed Todo's potential during an
                    astral survey of mystical nexus points. He observed the
                    young martial artist unconsciously tapping into dimensional
                    energies during his training, combining them with his
                    fighting techniques.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The Ancient One's scrolls spoke of warrior-mages who could
                    step between dimensions in combat, but the technique had
                    been lost for centuries. Todo's natural ability to merge
                    martial arts with dimensional manipulation marked him as a
                    potential heir to this legacy.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Awakening</strong>
                    Strange arranged to visit the temple, arriving just as Todo
                    experienced his first conscious teleport during an intensive
                    training session. Pushed to his limits, Todo instinctively
                    merged his defensive stance with a dimensional step,
                    vanishing from an incoming strike and reappearing behind his
                    sparring partner.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The temple's mystic energies surged in response, awakening
                    Todo's latent magical abilities. His martial arts forms
                    began to incorporate short-range teleports, allowing him to
                    flow through space as naturally as through physical stances.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Path Between</strong>
                    Under Strange's guidance, Todo learned to control this
                    fusion of magic and martial arts. His defensive techniques
                    evolved to include dimensional displacement, and his attacks
                    integrated teleportation to strike from unexpected angles.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    His signature "Void Step" maneuver emerged from combining
                    his blink ability with classic counter-attacks. By
                    predicting an opponent's movement and teleporting at the
                    right moment, he could turn their own momentum against them
                    through reverse-momentum throws.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Academy's Halls</strong>
                    Sponsored by Strange, Todo joined the Boston Avengers
                    Academy (BAA), which offered both mystical and superhero
                    training. Under the Academy’s controlled environment, he
                    refined his dimensional powers without risking larger
                    spatial instabilities.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Todo's studies focused on combining his powers in novel
                    ways—executing chain strikes through multiple teleports,
                    stabilizing defensive stances with spatial manipulation, and
                    employing rapid blink offensives that overwhelmed sparring
                    partners.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Present Day</strong>
                    Todo rigorously maintains his training schedule at BAA,
                    rising early to practice martial forms. His quarters hold a
                    small meditation area furnished with mystical texts from
                    Strange.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Acting as a bridge between conventional combat instructors
                    and mystical mentors, Todo helps others see how different
                    powers can mesh harmoniously. His capacity to swap positions
                    with allies during a fight makes him a prime training
                    partner for new recruits learning team dynamics.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Many Academy students spot him in the meditation garden,
                    moving gracefully while space seems to ripple around him.
                    Beneath his calm exterior lies a fierce dedication to
                    perfecting the interplay between martial arts and
                    dimensional magic.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Todo’s presence exemplifies the rebirth of an ancient,
                    mystical martial tradition—merging physical discipline with
                    arcane portals. Although still mastering his abilities, he
                    stands as a testament to the potential for unifying
                    corporeal and magical combat tactics in ways previously
                    thought lost.

                    Ancient scrolls from Todo's temple reference a weapon forged
                    at dimensional crossroads—a sanjiegun divided between
                    realities by mystic smiths. Dr. Strange, sensing the
                    artifact’s connection to Todo’s teleportation, recovered its
                    scattered fragments. Each segment houses echoes of various
                    dimensions, letting Todo channel his teleportation gifts
                    through the weapon’s arcane lineage.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The increased (+2) damage of the Voidbound Triskelion stems
                    from its ability to strike simultaneously through multiple
                    planes of existence. In actual combat, blue energy ripples
                    trace its path, marking the weapon’s passage through
                    overlapping realities.
