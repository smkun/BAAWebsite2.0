                    <strong>Chapter 1: The Perfect Game</strong><br />
                    Johnny Ransom grew up in South Boston, where baseball ruled
                    summer afternoons. He showed talent early, pitching
                    no-hitters in Little League and becoming Southie High's star
                    pitcher. His fastball topped 145 km/h by senior year,
                    earning him a spot in the Red Sox minor league system.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Working his way through Single-A ball with the Lowell
                    Spinners, Johnny developed a reputation for pinpoint
                    accuracy. Scouts noted his uncanny ability to place pitches
                    exactly where he wanted them, defying the usual learning
                    curve for young pitchers.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Chapter 2: The Awakening</strong><br />
                    During a crucial game against the Portland Sea Dogs,
                    Johnny's mutant abilities emerged. His fastball clocked at
                    225 km/h, shattering records and protective equipment. More
                    significantly, he began perceiving the game in slow motion,
                    dodging line drives before they left the bat.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The team management tried to keep his abilities quiet, but
                    videos of his impossible pitches went viral. The league
                    suspended him pending investigation, citing concerns about
                    "unfair advantages" and equipment safety.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Chapter 3: The Street League</strong><br />
                    Banned from professional baseball, Johnny found an outlet in
                    Boston's underground street baseball scene. These
                    unregulated games let him push his developing powers to
                    their limits. He learned to channel his speed into
                    quick-strike fighting moves, using baseball techniques as
                    the foundation for a unique combat style.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    His reputation grew among both baseball purists and the
                    mutant community. Exhibition games where he pitched to
                    blindfolded batters drew crowds, with Johnny catching his
                    own pitches after they passed home plate.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Chapter 4: The Call Up</strong><br />
                    Falcon discovered Johnny during a street game where he
                    single-handedly stopped an armed robbery without missing a
                    pitch. The display of speed, accuracy, and tactical thinking
                    caught the Avenger's attention.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The BAA offered Johnny a chance to transform his athletic
                    skills into heroic abilities. Though hesitant to abandon his
                    baseball dreams, he recognized the opportunity to use his
                    gifts for a greater purpose.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Chapter 5: A New League</strong><br />
                    At the Academy, Johnny's baseball background provided
                    unexpected advantages. His muscle memory and spatial
                    awareness accelerated his combat training. He developed
                    techniques combining his speed powers with baseball-inspired
                    moves, like his signature "Fastball Special" where he
                    delivers rapid-fire punches while moving at super speed.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He forms the Academy's second-string team with DEX797 and
                    Mistwalker, bringing athletic discipline to their tactical
                    approach. His ability to catch bullets complements DEX797's
                    ranged combat style, while his speed blast provides cover
                    for Mistwalker's infiltration tactics.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Present Day</strong><br />
                    Johnny maintains his connection to baseball, volunteering as
                    a coach for youth leagues in South Boston. He works with
                    young mutant athletes, helping them balance their powers
                    with fair play and sportsmanship.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    His quarters at BAA reflect his passion, decorated with
                    memorabilia from his brief pro career. He still practices
                    pitching daily, using his enhanced abilities to perfect new
                    techniques that combine baseball fundamentals with heroic
                    action.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The other students often find him in the Academy's training
                    room, working on combining his speed powers with
                    baseball-inspired combat moves. His athletic background
                    brings a competitive edge to team exercises, while his
                    understanding of teamwork helps coordinate the second-string
                    team's operations.
