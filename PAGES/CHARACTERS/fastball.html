                    <strong>The Perfect Game</strong> Johnny Ransom grew up in
                    South Boston, where baseball ruled summer afternoons. He
                    showed talent early, pitching no-hitters in Little League
                    and becoming Southie High's star pitcher. His fastball
                    topped 145 km/h by senior year, earning him a spot in the
                    Red Sox minor league system.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Working his way through Single-A ball with the Lowell
                    Spinners, Johnny developed a reputation for pinpoint
                    accuracy. Scouts noted his uncanny ability to place pitches
                    exactly where he wanted them, defying the usual learning
                    curve for young pitchers.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Awakening</strong> During a crucial game against
                    the Portland Sea Dogs, Johnny's mutant abilities emerged.
                    His fastball clocked at 225 km/h, shattering records and
                    protective equipment. More significantly, he began
                    perceiving the game in slow motion, dodging line drives
                    before they left the bat.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The team management tried to keep his abilities quiet, but
                    videos of his impossible pitches went viral. The league
                    suspended him pending investigation, citing concerns about
                    "unfair advantages" and equipment safety.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Street League</strong> Banned from professional
                    baseball, Johnny found an outlet in Boston's underground
                    street baseball scene. These unregulated games let him push
                    his developing powers to their limits. He learned to channel
                    his speed into quick-strike fighting moves, using baseball
                    techniques as the foundation for a unique combat style.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His reputation grew among both baseball purists and the
                    mutant community. Exhibition games where he pitched to
                    blindfolded batters drew crowds, with Johnny catching his
                    own pitches after they passed home plate.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Call Up</strong> Falcon discovered Johnny during
                    a street game where he single-handedly stopped an armed
                    robbery without missing a pitch. The display of speed,
                    accuracy, and tactical thinking caught the Avenger's
                    attention.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The BAA offered Johnny a chance to transform his athletic
                    skills into heroic abilities. Though hesitant to abandon his
                    baseball dreams, he recognized the opportunity to use his
                    gifts for a greater purpose.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A New League</strong> At the Academy, Johnny's
                    baseball background provided unexpected advantages. His
                    muscle memory and spatial awareness accelerated his combat
                    training. He developed techniques combining his speed powers
                    with baseball-inspired moves, like his signature "Fastball
                    Special" where he delivers rapid-fire punches while moving
                    at super speed.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    He forms the Academy's second-string team with DEX797 and
                    Mistwalker, bringing athletic discipline to their tactical
                    approach. His ability to catch bullets complements DEX797's
                    ranged combat style, while his speed blast provides cover
                    for Mistwalker's infiltration tactics.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Present Day</strong> Johnny maintains his connection
                    to baseball, volunteering as a coach for youth leagues in
                    South Boston. He works with young mutant athletes, helping
                    them balance their powers with fair play and sportsmanship.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His quarters at BAA reflect his passion, decorated with
                    memorabilia from his brief pro career. He still practices
                    pitching daily, using his enhanced abilities to perfect new
                    techniques that combine baseball fundamentals with heroic
                    action.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The other students often find him in the Academy's training
                    room, working on combining his speed powers with
                    baseball-inspired combat moves. His athletic background
                    brings a competitive edge to team exercises, while his
                    understanding of teamwork helps coordinate the second-string
                    team's operations.
