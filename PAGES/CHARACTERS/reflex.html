                    <strong>Built for War</strong>  
                    Nolan Graves was raised in a military family, expected to follow in his father’s footsteps. He excelled in special operations, developing reaction times that bordered on supernatural.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Reflex Initiative</strong>  
                    Selected for Project Reflex, Nolan underwent neurological augmentation to process sensory input at hyper-accelerated speeds. He could dodge bullets, predict enemy movements, and read the battlefield like a chessboard.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Cost of Perfection</strong>  
                    His enhanced perception became a curse. He saw threats before they happened, but his brain couldn’t process reality the same way anymore. The military shut down the project, cutting him loose as a liability.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Nowhere to Run</strong>  
                    With no mission and nowhere to go, Nolan drifted, haunted by fractured glimpses of the future. Every fight was over before it began, every conversation felt a second too slow. He lived like a ghost.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Academy's Offer</strong>  
                    The Boston Avengers Academy didn’t try to recruit him—they tried to help him. They offered control, a way to slow things down and use his abilities without losing himself.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A Ghost on the Battlefield</strong>  
                    On Team Gamma, Nolan’s combat instincts proved invaluable. He became Reflex—the soldier who saw danger before it arrived, the sniper who never missed, the fighter who was never where the enemy expected.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Man He Used to Be</strong>  
                    Outside of combat, he still struggles. The future never fully stops whispering. But at BAA, he has something he never had before—a team that sees him as more than just a weapon.
