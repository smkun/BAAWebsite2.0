                    <strong>Built for War</strong><br />
                    Nolan Graves wasn’t supposed to survive.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Born into a military family, he spent his childhood moving
                    between bases, raised under the rigid discipline of a father
                    who lived by the chain of command. Colonel Thomas Graves was
                    a career soldier, a man who believed in structure, duty, and
                    sacrifice. Nolan’s mother, Claire, had once been a
                    battlefield medic, but after years of deployments and
                    casualties, she left service to focus on raising her son.
                    She tried to balance out the cold efficiency of his father,
                    but it was hard to undo years of conditioning.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Nolan was expected to follow in his father’s footsteps. At
                    eighteen, he enlisted in the Army, breezing through basic
                    training before qualifying for special operations selection.
                    He had the instincts, the reaction time, and the nerves for
                    it—good enough to be molded into something useful. He spent
                    years in the field, deployed in classified operations,
                    earning a reputation as a marksman with near-supernatural
                    reflexes.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    But that wasn’t enough. The world was changing, and the
                    military needed more than just elite soldiers.
                </p>
                <p class="text">They needed something faster.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Reflex Initiative</strong><br />
                    Nolan was volunteered for an experimental combat enhancement
                    program known as Project Reflex—a Pentagon black project
                    buried under layers of classified funding. The goal: create
                    the next evolution of special forces operators through
                    neurological augmentation and enhanced battlefield
                    perception.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The scientists behind Reflex weren’t interested in brute
                    force—they wanted untouchable soldiers, warriors who could
                    move before the trigger was pulled, see the battlefield
                    unfolding before it happened. Through a combination of
                    experimental neuro-accelerants, synthetic neural tissue
                    grafts, and deep-learning AI prediction modeling, the
                    program retrained Nolan’s brain to process sensory input at
                    hyper-accelerated speeds.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    For a time, it worked. Reflex times cut in half. Reaction
                    speeds bordered on precognition. In combat simulations,
                    Nolan dodged bullets before they were fired, outmaneuvered
                    opponents before they even realized he had moved. His aim
                    sharpened, his ability to anticipate enemy fire became
                    uncanny. He could read body language in milliseconds,
                    predict movement before it happened, and evade even the most
                    chaotic engagements with ghost-like precision.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    But the human mind wasn’t meant to process the future before
                    it happened.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The overstimulation began to take its toll—split-second
                    images flashing before his eyes, the sensation of events
                    unfolding before they occurred. At first, it was just
                    battlefield awareness, a heightened sense of danger. Then
                    came glimpses of things that hadn’t happened yet. A grenade
                    rolling into the room seconds before it was thrown. The
                    sensation of a bullet grazing his skin before the enemy had
                    even pulled the trigger.
                </p>
                <p class="text">It became too much.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    By the time Project Reflex was shut down, its test subjects
                    were either dead or irreversibly damaged—except for Nolan.
                    He was the only one who survived, though the military brass
                    wouldn’t call it that. The headaches, the temporal drift,
                    the constant blur between action and reaction—he wasn’t a
                    soldier anymore. He was a liability. The perfect weapon with
                    no off switch.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Rather than risk exposing the project, the military cut him
                    loose. An honorable discharge. No records. No recognition.
                    Just a name on a classified report buried in the archives.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Nowhere to Run</strong><br />
                    Disoriented, burned out, and haunted by the fractured
                    glimpses of the future, Nolan spent the next year living
                    like a ghost—drifting between cheap motels, looking over his
                    shoulder, never staying in one place too long. He wasn’t
                    sure if the government still had tabs on him, but it didn’t
                    matter. He couldn’t trust himself.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The world didn’t move right anymore. Conversations felt a
                    second too slow. Fights were over before they began. He
                    could see the angles, the outcomes, the mistakes before they
                    happened, but it didn’t feel like skill anymore. It felt
                    like a curse.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    That’s when the Boston Avengers Academy found him.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Academy's Offer</strong><br />
                    BAA had been tracking unusual ex-military disappearances,
                    searching for recruits with unique circumstances. A lead
                    from a former operative in the intelligence community
                    pointed them to Nolan—a washed-up special forces soldier
                    with no records, no history, and an unexplainable ability to
                    avoid being hit in a fight.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    They didn’t send recruiters. They sent Ironclad.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Nolan didn’t care about the pitch. He didn’t want to be a
                    hero. But BAA wasn’t offering heroism—they were offering
                    control. A way to slow down. A way to use what was in his
                    head without falling apart from it.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He agreed, but with conditions. No tests. No doctors trying
                    to "fix" him. No experiments. He was done being a lab rat.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A Ghost on the Battlefield</strong><br />
                    At BAA, Nolan was placed on Team Gamma, a squad known for
                    its mix of raw talent and unpredictable elements. He was an
                    outsider at first, keeping his distance, reluctant to trust
                    anyone. But combat training changed that.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    On the field, he was impossible to hit. Fights ended before
                    they began, enemies locked into patterns he had already
                    played out in his head. His ability to read the battlefield
                    and redirect enemy fire made him invaluable to the team.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Where others charged in, he moved like a ghost, appearing in
                    the perfect position at the perfect time, snapping off
                    precision shots before an enemy even knew where he was.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    They started calling him Reflex, and the name stuck.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Man He Used to Be</strong><br />
                    Outside of combat, Nolan still struggles. The glimpses of
                    the future never fully stop—a second ahead, a moment before,
                    always nagging at the edges of his awareness. Sleep is
                    difficult. Crowds are worse. His mind still processes
                    threats before they exist, and that makes it hard to be a
                    person, not just a weapon.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    BAA gives him something he hasn’t had in years—stability. A
                    team that doesn’t just see him as an experiment gone wrong,
                    but as a man trying to keep himself together. He doesn’t
                    know if he’ll ever be a hero, but at least here, he isn’t
                    alone.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    And if the past has taught him anything, it’s that he’ll
                    always see danger coming—long before it knows he’s there.
