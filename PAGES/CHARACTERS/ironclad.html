                    <strong>A Mother's Legacy</strong>  
                    James Morrison grew up watching his mother, an ER nurse, work through long nights at Massachusetts General. Seeing her treat injuries sparked his obsession with designing better protection—armor that could prevent harm before it happened.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Foundations of Protection</strong>  
                    MIT recognized his talent early, offering him a full scholarship in engineering. His research into kinetic energy distribution landed him a job at Raytheon, where he focused on advanced protection systems.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Breaking Point</strong>  
                    When his mother was injured during a violent incident at the hospital, James became determined to develop personal defense systems. His focus shifted from military contracts to designing armor for real-world protection.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Evolution of Defense</strong>  
                    His prototype armor started as a crude shell, but a quantum field accident changed everything. The energy surge fused the system to him, turning his designs into a techno-organic mesh that adapted in real-time.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Guardian Rises</strong>  
                    Now, his body generates defensive fields naturally. He can extend his shields to protect others, fulfilling the dream he had as a child watching his mother patch up the injured. 
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Present Day</strong>  
                    James trains at Boston Avengers Academy, constantly refining his armor. His mother now oversees hospital security, unknowingly benefiting from the very technology her son created. 
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His bond with Marcus Chen (Pulse) strengthens both their abilities—his armor incorporating sound-dampening fields, while Pulse's sonic waves amplify Ironclad’s defenses. Together, they represent a new kind of shield—one built to protect rather than destroy.
