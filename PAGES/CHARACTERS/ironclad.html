                    <strong>A Mother's Legacy</strong>
                    James Morrison understood vulnerability from an early age.
                    His mother Catherine worked the emergency room night shift
                    at Massachusetts General Hospital, coming home with stories
                    of lives saved and lost. She raised him alone in their small
                    South Boston apartment, her scrubs often bearing the marks
                    of another challenging night. Young James spent countless
                    hours in the hospital break room, sketching designs in worn
                    notebooks while waiting for her shift to end. Each new
                    injury she treated sparked his imagination – better
                    protection, stronger armor, safer equipment.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Foundations of Protection</strong>
                    MIT's engineering program recognized his talent early,
                    offering him a full scholarship. James threw himself into
                    materials science and structural engineering, driven by
                    designs that had filled dozens of notebooks. His
                    undergraduate thesis on kinetic energy distribution caught
                    Raytheon's attention, earning him a coveted position in
                    their Advanced Protection Systems division.

                <p class="text">
                    In the MIT acoustics lab, he met Marcia Chen, another
                    engineer obsessed with wave propagation. Their late-night
                    discussions about harmonics and energy distribution laid
                    theoretical groundwork that would shape their future powers.
                    James focused on physical protection while Marcia explored
                    sound, but their work intertwined in unexpected ways.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Breaking Point</strong>
                    The attack happened during a routine night shift. A patient
                    in withdrawal became violent, the hospital's inadequate
                    security measures leaving staff vulnerable. Catherine
                    Morrison suffered severe injuries protecting a younger
                    nurse. James spent nights by her hospital bed, watching
                    monitors track his mother's vital signs. His notebooks
                    filled with new designs – not for military applications, but
                    personal protection systems that could prevent such
                    injuries.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Evolution of Defense</strong>
                    Raytheon's labs provided resources to develop his modular
                    armor system. The first prototype barely moved, a crude
                    shell of kinetic dampening fields. Each iteration brought
                    improvements, but military contractors pushed for weapons
                    integration. James resisted, his mother's recovery driving
                    his focus on pure defense.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The breakthrough came unexpectedly. Late one night, working
                    with experimental quantum field generators, James
                    miscalculated a power surge. The system overloaded, energy
                    cascading through his prototype. Instead of killing him, the
                    accident fused his neural patterns with the armor's control
                    systems. The technology literally became part of him,
                    responding to his thoughts, growing and adapting with his
                    body.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Guardian Rises</strong>
                    The accident transformed James into something new. His body
                    generated protective fields naturally, the armor's systems
                    evolving into a techno-organic mesh that emerged when
                    needed. Each defensive challenge taught the adaptive
                    protection new patterns. He discovered he could extend his
                    shields to protect others, the ability his mother's injury
                    had made him dream of years ago.

                <p class="text">
                    Raytheon wanted to study him, but an unexpected ally
                    emerged. Marcia Chen, now dealing with his own
                    transformation into Pulse, helped James understand his new
                    existence. Their combined knowledge of wave physics opened
                    new possibilities for both their powers. When the Boston
                    Avengers Academy offered James a position, Marcia encouraged
                    him to accept.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Present Day</strong>
                    James splits his time between BAA training and hospital
                    visits, where his mother now oversees staff security. His
                    armor continues to evolve, each mission teaching it new
                    defensive patterns. The break room where he once sketched as
                    a child now has better protective systems, his technology
                    quietly keeping the staff safer.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His relationship with Marcia strengthens both their
                    abilities. Ironclad's armor incorporates sound dampening
                    fields that let them work in close proximity, while Pulse's
                    sonic powers amplify the armor's defensive capabilities.
                    Together, they represent a new kind of protection – one that
                    could prevent others from suffering as James's mother did.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The scared child who sketched armor designs in a hospital
                    break room has become a living shield for others. While his
                    teammates sometimes rush toward danger, Ironclad moves to
                    protect – his mother's legacy living on in every life he
                    saves.
