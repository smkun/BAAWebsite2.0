                    <strong>The Scientific Path</strong><br />
                    Janos Nagy grew up in a modest apartment in Boston's Allston
                    neighborhood, the son of Hungarian immigrants who fled
                    during the 1956 revolution. From his earliest days, he
                    displayed an unusual fascination with insects, spending
                    hours observing ants on the sidewalk and collecting
                    specimens in jars. His father, a former university professor
                    who now worked as a janitor at MIT, encouraged this
                    scientific curiosity, helping him build a makeshift
                    laboratory in their apartment's spare room.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Through a scholarship program, Janos attended Boston Latin
                    School, where his aptitude for biology earned him
                    recognition. His high school mentor, Dr. Margaret Wu,
                    recognized his potential and introduced him to the world of
                    professional entomology. Under her guidance, he conducted
                    his first formal research project on urban ant colonies,
                    winning the state science fair.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Academia and Accident</strong><br />
                    Janos's work earned him a full scholarship to MIT, where he
                    double-majored in biology and chemistry. His undergraduate
                    thesis on venom synthesis in arthropods caught the attention
                    of Harvard's entomology department. Dr. Wu, now Dean of
                    Entomology, recruited him directly into their PhD program.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    In his second year of graduate studies, Janos led a
                    groundbreaking project studying toxic secretions in a newly
                    discovered species of cave-dwelling arthropod. During a
                    late-night experiment, a containment failure exposed him to
                    a combination of experimental enzyme catalysts and
                    concentrated venom samples.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The accident activated his dormant X-gene. Over several
                    painful hours, Janos's body underwent dramatic changes at
                    the cellular level. He discovered he could shrink to insect
                    size, generate toxic compounds, and eventually even fly. The
                    transformation terrified him initially, leading to weeks of
                    isolation in his apartment.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Mentorship and Control</strong><br />
                    Dr. Wu proved instrumental in helping Janos cope with his
                    transformation. Having secretly researched mutant biology
                    for years, she understood the implications of his change.
                    She helped him document and study his abilities from a
                    scientific perspective, treating them as an extension of his
                    research rather than a curse.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    His powers continued to develop. He gained precise control
                    over his size changes, mastered flight through
                    bio-mechanical wing generation, and learned to synthesize
                    and direct various toxins. His enhanced agility and reflexes
                    made him surprisingly effective at avoiding danger.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The turning point came during a laboratory crisis. A
                    newly-developed insecticide threatened to create a deadly
                    chain reaction in the ventilation system. Janos used his
                    abilities to shrink down, navigate the ducts, and neutralize
                    the compound with his own biochemically generated
                    antitoxins. The experience showed him his powers could serve
                    a greater purpose.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Hero's Path</strong><br />
                    Janos's actions caught the attention of Falcon, who had been
                    investigating a series of prevented laboratory accidents in
                    the Cambridge area. After observing him use his abilities to
                    stop several dangerous chemical spills, Falcon recognized
                    the potential in his precise control and scientific
                    approach. He approached Janos about joining the Boston
                    Avengers Academy, seeing in him the same methodical mindset
                    that had served Sam Wilson well in his own transition from
                    soldier to superhero.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Initially reluctant to abandon his academic career, Janos
                    found unexpected support from Dr. Wu. She helped him arrange
                    a modified research schedule that allowed him to continue
                    his studies while training at BAA. He adopted the codename
                    "Mandible," acknowledging both his powers and his scientific
                    background.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Team Integration</strong><br />
                    At BAA, Janos discovered his powers complemented his
                    teammates' abilities in unexpected ways. His shrinking
                    ability and flight made him an excellent scout, while his
                    toxin control provided unique tactical options. His
                    scientific background helped bridge the gap between the
                    team's more academic and practical members.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He formed a particular bond with Storm Weaver, finding
                    common ground in their scientific approaches to heroism. His
                    ability to analyze problems at microscopic levels proved
                    invaluable during joint operations with TitanPrime, while
                    Mistwalker helped him master stealth applications of his
                    powers.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Present Day</strong><br />
                    Janos continues to balance his roles as scientist and
                    superhero, maintaining his research position at Harvard
                    while training with BAA. Dr. Wu serves as both his academic
                    advisor and superhero mentor, helping him explore the
                    scientific implications of his powers while guiding his
                    growth as a hero.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    He lives in the BAA dormitories but frequently returns to
                    his old neighborhood, using his abilities to protect the
                    community that shaped him. His parents' store has become an
                    unofficial safe house, with his mother leaving out food for
                    him during late-night patrols, never directly acknowledging
                    but quietly supporting his new path.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The scientific community remains unaware that one of their
                    promising young researchers spends his nights as a
                    superhero. Janos works to protect both worlds, believing his
                    understanding of biology and chemistry makes him uniquely
                    suited to handle threats at all scales, from microscopic to
                    massive.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    His greatest ongoing challenge is reconciling his
                    methodical, scientific nature with the often chaotic reality
                    of superheroism. Yet with each mission, he finds new ways to
                    apply his powers and knowledge in service of others,
                    evolving from a purely academic researcher into something
                    far more impactful: a hero who can literally see the biggest
                    problems from the smallest perspectives.
