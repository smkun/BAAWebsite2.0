                    <strong>The Scientific Path</strong> Janos Nagy grew up in a
                    modest apartment in Boston's Allston neighborhood, the son
                    of Hungarian immigrants who fled during the 1956 revolution.
                    From his earliest days, he displayed an unusual fascination
                    with insects, spending hours observing ants on the sidewalk
                    and collecting specimens in jars. His father, a former
                    university professor who now worked as a janitor at MIT,
                    encouraged this scientific curiosity, helping him build a
                    makeshift laboratory in their apartment's spare room.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Through a scholarship program, Janos attended Boston Latin
                    School, where his aptitude for biology earned him
                    recognition. His high school mentor, Dr. Margaret Wu,
                    recognized his potential and introduced him to the world of
                    professional entomology. Under her guidance, he conducted
                    his first formal research project on urban ant colonies,
                    winning the state science fair.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Academia and Accident</strong> Janos's work earned
                    him a full scholarship to MIT, where he double-majored in
                    biology and chemistry. His undergraduate thesis on venom
                    synthesis in arthropods caught the attention of Harvard's
                    entomology department. Dr. Wu, now Dean of Entomology,
                    recruited him directly into their PhD program.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    In his second year of graduate studies, Janos led a
                    groundbreaking project studying toxic secretions in a newly
                    discovered species of cave-dwelling arthropod. During a
                    late-night experiment, a containment failure exposed him to
                    a combination of experimental enzyme catalysts and
                    concentrated venom samples.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The accident activated his dormant X-gene. Over several
                    painful hours, Janos's body underwent dramatic changes at
                    the cellular level. He discovered he could shrink to insect
                    size, generate toxic compounds, and eventually even fly. The
                    transformation terrified him initially, leading to weeks of
                    isolation in his apartment.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Mentorship and Control</strong> Dr. Wu proved
                    instrumental in helping Janos cope with his transformation.
                    Having secretly researched mutant biology for years, she
                    understood the implications of his change. She helped him
                    document and study his abilities from a scientific
                    perspective, treating them as an extension of his research
                    rather than a curse.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His powers continued to develop. He gained precise control
                    over his size changes, mastered flight through
                    bio-mechanical wing generation, and learned to synthesize
                    and direct various toxins. His enhanced agility and reflexes
                    made him surprisingly effective at avoiding danger.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The turning point came during a laboratory crisis. A
                    newly-developed insecticide threatened to create a deadly
                    chain reaction in the ventilation system. Janos used his
                    abilities to shrink down, navigate the ducts, and neutralize
                    the compound with his own biochemically generated
                    antitoxins. The experience showed him his powers could serve
                    a greater purpose.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Hero's Path</strong> Janos's actions caught the
                    attention of Falcon, who had been investigating a series of
                    prevented laboratory accidents in the Cambridge area. After
                    observing him use his abilities to stop several dangerous
                    chemical spills, Falcon recognized the potential in his
                    precise control and scientific approach. He approached Janos
                    about joining the Boston Avengers Academy, seeing in him the
                    same methodical mindset that had served Sam Wilson well in
                    his own transition from soldier to superhero.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Initially reluctant to abandon his academic career, Janos
                    found unexpected support from Dr. Wu. She helped him arrange
                    a modified research schedule that allowed him to continue
                    his studies while training at BAA. He adopted the codename
                    "Mandible," acknowledging both his powers and his scientific
                    background.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Team Integration</strong> At BAA, Janos discovered
                    his powers complemented his teammates' abilities in
                    unexpected ways. His shrinking ability and flight made him
                    an excellent scout, while his toxin control provided unique
                    tactical options. His scientific background helped bridge
                    the gap between the team's more academic and practical
                    members.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    He formed a particular bond with Storm Weaver, finding
                    common ground in their scientific approaches to heroism. His
                    ability to analyze problems at microscopic levels proved
                    invaluable during joint operations with TitanPrime, while
                    Mistwalker helped him master stealth applications of his
                    powers.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Present Day</strong> Janos continues to balance his
                    roles as scientist and superhero, maintaining his research
                    position at Harvard while training with BAA. Dr. Wu serves
                    as both his academic advisor and superhero mentor, helping
                    him explore the scientific implications of his powers while
                    guiding his growth as a hero.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    He lives in the BAA dormitories but frequently returns to
                    his old neighborhood, using his abilities to protect the
                    community that shaped him. His parents' store has become an
                    unofficial safe house, with his mother leaving out food for
                    him during late-night patrols, never directly acknowledging
                    but quietly supporting his new path.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The scientific community remains unaware that one of their
                    promising young researchers spends his nights as a
                    superhero. Janos works to protect both worlds, believing his
                    understanding of biology and chemistry makes him uniquely
                    suited to handle threats at all scales, from microscopic to
                    massive.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His greatest ongoing challenge is reconciling his
                    methodical, scientific nature with the often chaotic reality
                    of superheroism. Yet with each mission, he finds new ways to
                    apply his powers and knowledge in service of others,
                    evolving from a purely academic researcher into something
                    far more impactful: a hero who can literally see the biggest
                    problems from the smallest perspectives.
