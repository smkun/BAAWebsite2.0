                    <strong>Musical Foundations</strong>  
                    Raised in Boston Symphony Hall, Marcia Chen understood sound on a deep level. Her parents were renowned musicians, but while her sister pursued performance, Marcia studied the physics of sound itself.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Innovation</strong>  
                    As an acoustic engineer, Marcia developed revolutionary waveguide technology. Her research caught the attention of MIT and fellow engineer James Morrison, whose work in energy distribution would later lead him to become Ironclad.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Resonance</strong>  
                    A lab accident exposed Marcia to an unstable acoustic feedback loop. Trapped in pure sound for over three minutes, her body transformed. Now, she generates and manipulates sonic energy with precision beyond known science.

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Silent Recovery</strong>  
                    Her powers were initially uncontrollable. Confined to an isolation chamber, even her breath disrupted electronic equipment. Only experimental sound-dampening tech developed by her boyfriend Aiden allowed him to visit safely.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A New Symphony</strong>  
                    Marcia now channels her abilities to generate devastating sonic blasts, create force barriers, and "see" using echolocation. Her hypersensitive hearing requires constant meditation, and she can no longer attend live concerts without special protection.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Present Day</strong>  
                    Symphony Hall remains her sanctuary, where she practices control over her resonance. No longer just an engineer, Marcia has become the conductor of sonic energy, composing a new symphony of power.
