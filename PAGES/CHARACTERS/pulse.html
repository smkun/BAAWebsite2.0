                    <strong>Musical Foundations</strong><br />
                    In the historic halls of Boston's Symphony Hall, where music
                    soared for over a century, Marcia Chen found her calling not
                    in playing instruments but in mastering the very nature of
                    sound itself. Born to Lisa Chen, a renowned piano instructor
                    at the New England Conservatory, and David Chen, the first
                    violin for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Marcia developed
                    an intimate understanding of acoustics from her earliest
                    days.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Unlike her sister Grace, who followed their parents' path
                    into performance at Berklee College of Music, Marcia was
                    fascinated by the physics of sound. She spent countless
                    hours in Symphony Hall's hidden spaces, studying how sound
                    waves moved through the historic architecture, learning
                    their patterns and possibilities.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Innovation</strong><br />
                    By her late twenties, Marcia had earned a reputation as an
                    acoustic innovator. Her experimental waveguide system
                    promised to revolutionize sound reproduction, creating
                    perfect acoustic environments in any space. Dr. Sarah
                    Thompson, her mentor and head of acoustic research,
                    supported her increasingly ambitious experiments, even as
                    others warned of potential risks.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The project drew attention from various technical circles,
                    including fellow engineer James Morrison, whose work on wave
                    propagation would later influence his path to become
                    Ironclad. They spent long nights discussing theoretical
                    applications of wave physics, unaware they were both on
                    paths toward extraordinary transformation.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Resonance</strong><br />
                    The accident occurred during a late-night calibration
                    session. Marcia noticed abnormal patterns in the waveguide
                    readings—harmonics that shouldn't exist, resonances that
                    defied known physics. A massive power surge triggered a
                    cascading feedback loop as she rushed to shut down the
                    system. The overlapping sound waves created a standing
                    pattern that trapped her in a node of pure acoustic energy.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    For three minutes and seventeen seconds, Marcia existed in a
                    state between solid matter and pure sound. The experience
                    should have killed her. Instead, it fundamentally altered
                    her relationship with sonic energy. Her body became a living
                    waveguide, capable of generating, controlling, and
                    manipulating sound in ways that defied scientific
                    explanation.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Silent Recovery</strong><br />
                    The three weeks following the accident tested Marcia's
                    sanity. Confined to a specially constructed isolation room
                    at Massachusetts General Hospital, she struggled to control
                    her new abilities. Random sonic pulses shattered windows and
                    disrupted electronic equipment. Only her boyfriend Aiden,
                    protected by experimental sound-dampening technology he
                    developed at MIT, could safely visit.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Dr. Thompson converted her acoustics lab into a testing
                    facility, working tirelessly to understand her condition.
                    She discovered that Marcia's abilities manifested strongest
                    in the infrasound range—frequencies below human hearing that
                    could affect physical objects. This breakthrough helped
                    Marcia begin to master her powers.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A New Symphony</strong><br />
                    Now, Marcia channels her powers with a precision that
                    matches her former technical expertise. She can generate
                    sonic blasts capable of shattering steel, create protective
                    barriers of resonating air, and "see" through sophisticated
                    echolocation. Her understanding of acoustic physics,
                    combined with her mutant abilities, makes her a formidable
                    hero and valued member of the BAA.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Yet challenges remain. A constant low-level hum accompanies
                    her every moment, intensifying with stress. Her
                    hypersensitive hearing requires regular meditation to
                    control, and she can no longer attend the concerts that once
                    filled her life without specialized protection. The accident
                    left a stark white streak in her otherwise dark hair, a
                    visible reminder of her transformation.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The Symphony Hall still stands as her sanctuary, though she
                    now visits after hours when the space is empty. In those
                    quiet moments, surrounded by the perfect acoustics that
                    shaped her early career, Marcia practices the delicate
                    control her powers demand. She's no longer just an engineer
                    studying sound—she has become a conductor of sonic energy,
                    composing a new symphony of power.
