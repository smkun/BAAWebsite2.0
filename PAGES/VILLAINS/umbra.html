                <p class="text">
                    Youngest of Maria's daughters, Selena was born during a solar eclipse,
                    a fact Maria considered significant. As a child, Selena was unnaturally
                    quiet, preferring shadows to light and speaking very little. Her power
                    manifested gradually—teachers reported she sometimes seemed to
                    disappear in class, and neighborhood children claimed she could "melt
                    into walls."
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    By 12, Selena could consciously manipulate shadows, using them as hiding
                    places and eventually as transportation. Maria helped her understand her
                    gifts by sharing old family stories about shadow-walkers in their
                    ancestry.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    While Elena focused on academics and Danielle on her social connections,
                    Selena developed into the family's observer. She used her abilities to
                    monitor gang activities around the diner, watching from the shadows and
                    reporting movements to keep her family safe.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    After high school, Selena worked as a night security guard at Boston
                    Museum of Fine Arts, using her shadow abilities to catch potential
                    thieves. She developed her power to create solid shadow
                    constructs—simple weapons and tools that lasted briefly in light but
                    remained permanent in darkness.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Maria's death shattered Selena's reserved demeanor. The once-quiet
                    observer became a silent assassin, using shadow-walking to infiltrate
                    gang hideouts and police stations, gathering evidence of corruption
                    while leaving no trace.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Within the Tribulation, Selena handles reconnaissance and extraction.
                    Her ability to travel through connected shadows lets her move the team
                    between locations undetected. She rarely speaks now, communicating
                    primarily through Elena's telepathic link, and has developed the
                    disturbing ability to temporarily remove a person's shadow—causing
                    disorientation and paranoia.

                    These three women, bound by blood and loss, transformed from Maria
                    Thompson's daughters into Isaiah's instruments of vengeance, each
                    carrying a piece of their mother's legacy while walking a path she
                    never would have chosen for them.
