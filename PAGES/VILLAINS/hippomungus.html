                    <strong>Early Life</strong> Born in the wild, Hippomungus
                    spent his early years like any other hippo, roaming the
                    river and grazing on riverbank vegetation. His habitat was
                    slowly being overtaken by industrial waste and urban
                    sprawl—a grim backdrop that would set the stage for an
                    extraordinary transformation.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Turning Point</strong> One fateful night, a
                    covert chemical spill occurred from a nearby clandestine
                    industrial facility. The spill wasn't just ordinary waste—it
                    was laced with experimental mutagens being tested for
                    purposes never meant for public knowledge. The contaminated
                    water and soil seeped into the river, bathing young
                    Hippomungus in potent chemicals.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Over the following weeks, he underwent dramatic physical
                    changes. His size increased dramatically, his muscles became
                    denser, and his skin thickened into a near-impenetrable
                    hide. But the transformation wasn't merely physical—it
                    reached deep into his mind, awakening something
                    unprecedented.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Awakening of Sentience</strong> The mutagens didn't
                    only alter his body—they affected his brain. Once a simple,
                    instinct-driven animal, he began to develop an awareness
                    that set him apart from his kin. In a rare moment of clarity
                    amid the chaos of his transformation, Hippomungus realized
                    he could think, plan, and act with purpose.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    This newfound sentience came with a price: a brutal,
                    unyielding temper that would later manifest as his berserker
                    nature. The cognitive leap from simple hippopotamus to
                    sentient being brought with it a complexity of emotions and
                    thoughts he was never meant to possess.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Rise in the Underworld</strong> Displaced from his
                    natural habitat, the young mutated hippo was captured by
                    local criminals. They saw not a wild animal, but a powerful
                    tool for their operations. With a mix of training and raw
                    street survival, he quickly adapted to his new role. His
                    natural strength, enhanced by his mutation, made him an
                    invaluable enforcer.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Embracing his transformation, he adopted the moniker
                    "Hippomungus"—a name that struck fear into the hearts of
                    those who crossed his path. His reputation grew in the
                    criminal underworld as a force of nature, an unstoppable
                    juggernaut when his berserker rage took hold.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Legacy of Power</strong> Today, Hippomungus stands
                    as a testament to how extreme circumstances can forge
                    unlikely legends. With a healing factor, berserker fury, and
                    a suite of devastating combat abilities, he serves as the
                    brutal muscle for a criminal network—one whose savage
                    strength and unpredictable nature make him both a powerful
                    ally and a dangerous adversary.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Despite his fearsome reputation, traces of his original
                    nature remain. Like his unchanged kin, he still seeks out
                    water bodies, though now he uses them strategically in urban
                    warfare. His territory is no longer a simple riverbank but
                    the sprawling concrete jungle of the city's underworld.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    As Hippomungus continues to evolve in his role, one thing
                    remains clear: he represents a unique fusion of primal force
                    and calculated intelligence, a combination that makes him
                    one of the most formidable figures in the criminal
                    landscape. His story serves as a dark reminder of how human
                    interference with nature can create forces beyond control.
