                <p class="text">
                    Middle child Danielle was the family storm. From early age, her emotions
                    strongly affected Boston's weather—her tantrums bringing
                    thunderstorms and her joy creating perfect sunny days. Maria initially
                    dismissed these coincidences until a school bully pushed 10-year-old
                    Danielle too far. The resulting lightning strike that hit the school
                    playground injured no one but left a perfect circle of scorched earth
                    around the bully.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Unlike Elena's disciplined approach to her powers, Danielle struggled
                    with control. Her tight bond with Isaiah helped—he understood her
                    volatility and taught her to channel anger into focused bursts rather
                    than wild storms.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    At 14, Danielle ran away to Providence after a fight with her mother,
                    triggering the worst blizzard Boston had seen in decades. When police
                    found her three days later, Maria sought help from a weather scientist
                    who confirmed Danielle's abilities and taught her atmospheric pressure
                    control techniques.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Danielle became the cheerful counterbalance to Elena's seriousness and
                    Isaiah's intensity. She took community college classes in meteorology
                    while working at the diner, helping customers with her sunny disposition
                    while using her powers to ensure good weather for outdoor events.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    After Maria's death, Danielle's grief manifested as a three-day
                    downpour that flooded parts of Dorchester. Her powers intensified with
                    her rage—she could now generate targeted lightning strikes and create
                    localized atmospheric pressure changes to incapacitate enemies.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Within the Tribulation, Danielle serves as the group's heavy hitter,
                    capable of disabling electronics and creating diversions through weather
                    manipulation. She maintains her affable personality as a front when
                    gathering intelligence but unleashes devastating storms during
                    operations.
