                    James Colvin discovered his mutation at age 14 when a
                    schoolyard fight ended with his opponent in the hospital
                    from an unknown toxin. His working-class Irish family in
                    South Boston tried to hide his abilities, but local gangs
                    took notice. By 16, he worked as an enforcer, his natural
                    venom making him valuable in "sending messages."

                <p class="text">
                    He built his empire methodically over 15 years. Starting
                    with protection rackets in South Boston, he expanded into
                    gambling, smuggling, and construction fraud. His nickname
                    came from his cold, calculating nature and the painful
                    deaths his venom caused. Unlike flashier criminals, Colvin
                    runs his operation like a business.

                    His territory now includes the Seaport District and parts of
                    South Boston. He maintains legitimate businesses in
                    construction and waste management while controlling much of
                    Boston's drug trade. He avoids direct conflict with other
                    powered individuals, preferring to hire normal criminals and
                    use his abilities only when necessary.

                    His current focus is expanding into biotech protection
                    rackets, extorting companies that cannot afford legitimate
                    security. This brings him into conflict with both heroes and
                    rival criminals looking to exploit Boston's tech sector.
