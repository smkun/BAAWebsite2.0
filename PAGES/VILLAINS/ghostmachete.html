                    Commander Demissie "Ghost Machete" Tekle built his
                    reputation in the Ethiopian civil conflicts. Originally a
                    military officer, he turned warlord in the border regions by
                    using experimental military tech to establish control over
                    disputed territories.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His phase-shifting abilities stem from stolen prototype
                    equipment intended for UN peacekeeping forces. This
                    experimental phase-tech gave him a significant advantage –
                    he could appear inside secured compounds, eliminate
                    resistance, and vanish before reinforcements arrived.

                <p class="text">
                    His forces specialize in village raids and resource control,
                    particularly focusing on rare earth mineral deposits. In one
                    mission, a UN investigation into missing aid shipments
                    turned violent when international forces moved to intervene;
                    Ghost Machete's forces ambushed them using his inside
                    knowledge of military protocols. The conflict exposed his
                    ties to international arms dealers and tech smugglers.

                    His personal hunt for Mistwalker is driven by both revenge
                    and practicality—any surviving witnesses to his operations
                    represent loose ends he cannot tolerate.
