                    <strong>A Name Born of Power</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Isaiah Thompson didn't ask to be different. He didn't want
                    to see the world move slower around him, to feel his nerves
                    crackling with energy that had no outlet. But from a young
                    age, he knew. He was more.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Growing up in Dorchester, Boston, meant learning to move
                    fast. To stay ahead. The streets had a rhythm—who to avoid,
                    where not to walk, when to fight and when to run. Isaiah
                    learned quickly. But it wasn't just instinct. It was
                    something deeper.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    By the time he was ten, he could feel things before they
                    happened. He saw the twitch in someone's knuckles before a
                    punch landed. Heard the shift in their breath before they
                    shouted. Reacted before they even made their move.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    People said he had eyes in the back of his head.
                </p>

                <p class="text">That wasn't quite right.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    What he had was power—raw, untapped, waiting.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Aunt Who Raised Him</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Maria Thompson wasn't just his aunt—she was his mother in
                    every way that mattered. She worked long hours at The Blue
                    Plate Special, her little diner tucked away on a busy
                    street, serving anyone who walked through the door.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Isaiah spent his childhood in that diner. Booths filled with
                    old-timers telling stories, teenagers skipping school,
                    workers grabbing coffee before their shifts. Maria knew
                    everyone. She looked out for them.
                </p>

                <p class="text">And she looked out for him.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    She did her best to keep him away from the gangs, the
                    violence. But the streets had their own gravity.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    At fifteen, that gravity finally pulled him in.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The First Taste of Power</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text">He didn't start the fight.</p>

                <p class="text">But he sure as hell ended it.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    Three older boys cornered him in an alley. Demanding his
                    phone, his jacket. He knew them—part of a local crew trying
                    to prove themselves. They wanted to hurt him.
                </p>

                <p class="text">They never got the chance.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    A fist swung at his face. Before Isaiah even thought about
                    moving, his body reacted. The world slowed. His vision
                    sharpened. A white-hot pulse of energy erupted from his
                    palms, flinging his attackers backwards like rag dolls.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    One landed against a dumpster, shoulder dislocated. Another
                    hit the pavement, gasping for air. The third? A clean shot
                    to the kneecap, that's right! Energy arrow to the knee!
                </p>

                <p class="text">Not lethal. But precise.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    Isaiah stood over them, heart hammering. He hadn't aimed—but
                    somehow, every blast had landed exactly where he intended.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    And for the first time in his life, he realized:
                </p>

                <p class="text">I could have done worse.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>A Hero's Path</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Word spread fast. There was a kid in Dorchester who could
                    throw people like they weighed nothing. Gangs started
                    watching him. Some wanted him on their side.
                </p>

                <p class="text">Maria? She wasn't having it.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    She told him the truth: Power isn't what makes a man. It's
                    what he does with it.
                </p>

                <p class="text">Then the X-Men came.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    They had been watching. They had seen him protect people
                    during a gang fight. Shielding civilians with an invisible
                    wall of force, redirecting bullets mid-air with terrifying
                    precision.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    They made him an offer. Training. A real future. A place on
                    Krakoa.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Maria told him to go. To become something better.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    And so, at sixteen, Isaiah left Boston behind.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Training for Power</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Krakoa was unlike anything Isaiah had ever imagined. A place
                    where mutants weren't feared or hunted. Where power wasn't a
                    curse—it was a weapon. A tool.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    At first, he struggled. His abilities were instinctual, raw.
                    His barriers were weak. His blasts were powerful but
                    inconsistent. He lacked control.
                </p>

                <p class="text">That changed under the right teachers.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    He trained alongside veteran warriors, learning to turn his
                    abilities into something tactical. His barriers became
                    stronger—capable of shielding entire squads, deflecting
                    energy blasts, withstanding firepower.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    His force blasts became more than just raw energy. They
                    became precise. He could target pressure points, armor
                    weaknesses, even disarm opponents without killing them.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    But Krakoa didn't just teach him power. It taught him war.
                </p>

                <p class="text">And Isaiah? He learned fast.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    His leadership skills became evident. He understood
                    strategy, tactics, battlefield positioning. Others followed
                    him because he knew how to control a fight.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    At nineteen, he was one of the best. A hero in the making.
                </p>

                <p class="text">Then he got the call.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Return and the Fall</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text">Dorchester wasn't supposed to feel smaller.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    But when Isaiah returned, it did. The streets hadn't
                    changed. The people hadn't changed. But something was
                    missing.
                </p>

                <p class="text">Maria was gone.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    A new gang had moved in while he was away. Shaking down
                    businesses for protection money. Extorting the people Maria
                    had spent her life serving.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    She stood her ground. She trusted the police to handle it.
                </p>

                <p class="text">They didn't.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    One night, the Blue Plate Special burned. Maria was trapped
                    inside. The fire spread too fast.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    By the time Isaiah got there, it was too late. There was
                    nothing left but charred wood and smoke.
                </p>

                <p class="text">He searched for answers. And he found them.</p>

                <p class="text">Detective Ray Costigan.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    Maria had gone to him. Begged for help. Costigan had waved
                    her off, let the gang do what they wanted. He had taken
                    their money.
                </p>

                <p class="text">And now she was dead.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    Isaiah went to the station. Demanded justice. They laughed
                    in his face.
                </p>

                <p class="text">That's when Isaiah finally understood.</p>

                <p class="text">There was no justice. Only power.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    <strong>The Sisters Three</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text">He wasn't alone in his grief.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    His cousins—Elena, Danielle, and Selena—had lost their
