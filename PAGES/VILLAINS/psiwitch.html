                    Elena was the eldest of Maria Thompson's daughters, taking on
                    responsibility from an early age. While her sisters and cousin Isaiah
                    played in the streets of Dorchester, Elena worked in the diner's
                    kitchen, listening to customers' thoughts without realizing her ability
                    was unusual.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Her telepathic powers emerged at 13 when she accidentally projected a
                    customer's violent thoughts onto nearby patrons, causing panic. Maria
                    recognized what was happening and taught Elena meditation techniques
                    passed down through generations to control her gift.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    By 16, Elena mastered basic telepathy but struggled with ethics. She
                    used her powers to warn her mother about dangerous customers and helped
                    Isaiah avoid street conflicts, stepping in when his impulsiveness
                    threatened trouble.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    After graduating high school, Elena attended Boston University on
                    scholarship, studying psychology to understand her abilities better. She
                    worked part-time at Massachusetts General Hospital, using her powers
                    discreetly to help trauma patients. Her research into memory pathways
                    unlocked more advanced abilities, including memory manipulation and
                    thought projection.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    When Maria died, Elena left her promising career. Her powers evolved
                    from healing to offenseâ€”she could now inflict psychic pain, extract
                    information forcibly, and implant false memories. The once-compassionate
                    healer became the Tribulation's interrogator, using psychological
                    torture to extract information about Detective Costigan's corruption
                    network.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Elena remains the most rational of the group, torn between vengeance and
                    her healer's instinct. She's the strategic mind behind their
                    operations but sometimes questions whether their path honors what her
                    mother taught her.
