                    Michael Reeves wasn't always the flame-wreathed terrorist he
                    is today. He started as a dedicated firefighter at Engine
                    Company 28, saving lives alongside his fellow first
                    responders. But his fate changed during one catastrophic
                    chemical fire.

                    Inferno's rampage left 12 firehouses damaged or destroyed,
                    23 firefighters injured, and millions in infrastructure
                    damage. His capture marked the end of a six-month campaign
                    of terror against Boston's emergency services. He now
                    resides in a specialized containment cell, his flames
                    burning with unquenchable rage.

                    With his capture, Boston rebuilds - but the scars of his
                    attacks remain, both on the city and in the minds of those
                    who once called him brother.
